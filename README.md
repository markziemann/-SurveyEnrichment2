# SurveyEnrichment2
A systematic investigation of enrichment analysis rigour

In this work we will collate a corpus of high impact journal articles that use enrichment analysis, and we will screen them for methodological problems.
These include lack of methodological detail, and statistical problems.
The problematic ones will undergo reproduction and replication.
Reproduction to check that we can get the same results with the same methods and data.
Replication to fix any problems with the methods and see if the conclusions of the study are still valid.
