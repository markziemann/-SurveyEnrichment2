TI  - DAVID: a web server for functional enrichment analysis and functional annotation 
      of gene lists (2021 update).
PG  - W216-W221
LID - 10.1093/nar/gkac194 [doi]
AB  - DAVID is a popular bioinformatics resource system including a web server and web 
      service for functional annotation and enrichment analyses of gene lists. It 
      consists of a comprehensive knowledgebase and a set of functional analysis tools. 
      Here, we report all updates made in 2021. The DAVID Gene system was rebuilt to 
      gain coverage of more organisms, which increased the taxonomy coverage from 17 
      399 to 55 464. All existing annotation types have been updated, if available, 
      based on the new DAVID Gene system. Compared with the last version, the number of 
      gene-term records for most annotation types within the updated Knowledgebase have 
      significantly increased. Moreover, we have incorporated new annotations in the 
      Knowledgebase including small molecule-gene interactions from PubChem, drug-gene 
      interactions from DrugBank, tissue expression information from the Human Protein 
      Atlas, disease information from DisGeNET, and pathways from WikiPathways and 
      PathBank. Eight of ten subgroups split from Uniprot Keyword annotation were 
      assigned to specific types. Finally, we added a species parameter for uploading a 
      list of gene symbols to minimize the ambiguity between species, which increases 
      the efficiency of the list upload and eliminates confusion for users. These 
      current updates have significantly expanded the Knowledgebase and enhanced the 
      discovery power of DAVID.

TI  - Coronary and carotid artery dysfunction and K(V)7 overexpression in a mouse model 
      of Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome.
LID - 10.1007/s11357-023-00808-3 [doi]
AB  - Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) is an extremely rare genetic disease 
      caused by expression of progerin, a lamin A variant that is also expressed at low 
      levels in non-HGPS individuals. Although HGPS patients die predominantly from 
      myocardial infarction and stroke, the mechanisms that provoke pathological 
      alterations in the coronary and cerebral arteries in HGPS remain ill defined. 
      Here, we assessed vascular function in the coronary arteries (CorAs) and carotid 
      arteries (CarAs) of progerin-expressing Lmna(G609G/G609G) mice (G609G), both in 
      resting conditions and after hypoxic stimulus. Wire myography, pharmacological 
      screening, and gene expression studies demonstrated vascular atony and stenosis, 
      as well as other functional alterations in progeroid CorAs and CarAs and aorta. 
      These defects were associated with loss of vascular smooth muscle cells and 
      overexpression of the K(V)7 family of voltage-dependent potassium channels. 
      Compared with wild-type controls, G609G mice showed reduced median survival upon 
      chronic isoproterenol exposure, a baseline state of chronic cardiac hypoxia 
      characterized by overexpression of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α and 3α genes, and 
      increased cardiac vascularization. Our results shed light on the mechanisms 
      underlying progerin-induced coronary and carotid artery disease and identify 
      K(V)7 channels as a candidate target for the treatment of HGPS.

AB  - Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is a common lung cancer. Although there are various 
      treatments for LUAD, its prognosis remains poor. Therefore, it is imperative to 
      identify new targets and develop novel therapeutic strategies. In this study, we 
      analyze the expression of proline rich 11 (PRR11) in pan cancer based on The 
      Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, and explore the prognostic value of PRR11 in 
      LUAD by GEPIA2 (Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis, version 2) 
      database. In addition, the relationship between PRR11 and the clinicopathological 
      features of LUAD was analyzed using UALCAN database. The association between 
      PRR11 expression and immune infiltration was accessed. The PRR11 related genes 
      were screened using LinkOmics and GEPIA2. Gene Ontology Term Enrichment (GO) and 
      Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis was performed by David 
      database. The results suggested that the expression of PRR11 in most tumor 
      tissues was significantly higher than that in normal tissues. In LUAD patients, 
      high expression of PRR11 was associated with shortened first progression survival 
      (FPS), overall survival (OS) and post progression survival (PPS), and correlated 
      with individual cancer stage, race, gender, smoking habit, and tissue subtype. 
      Besides, the high expression of PRR11 was accompanied by a relatively higher 
      infiltration level of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and myeloid-derived 
      suppressor cell (MDSC), and decreased infiltration level of CD8+ T cells in the 
      tumor microenvironment. GO analyses showed that PRR11 participated in biological 
      processes such as cell division and cell cycle, and was involved in protein 
      binding and microtubule binding functions. KEGG analyses revealed that PRR11 was 
      implicated in p53 signaling pathway. All the results indicated that PRR11 might 
      be an independent prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for LUAD.

TI  - Identification of the active ingredients and pharmacological effects of Kuntai 
      capsules in the treatment of primary ovarian insufficiency: A review.

LID - e33884
AB  - Kuntai capsules are effective in controlling primary ovarian insufficiency (POI). 
      However, the precise mechanisms underlying the pharmacological effects of Kuntai 
      capsules remain unclear. This study aimed to screen the active components and 
      underlying mechanisms of Kuntai capsules for POI treatment using network 
      pharmacology protocols and molecular docking technology. Potential active 
      constituents in the chemical composition of Kuntai capsules were obtained from 
      the Traditional Chinese Medicine System Pharmacology Database. Targets for POI 
      were obtained from the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man and Gene Cards 
      database. All target data were integrated to identify the active ingredients of 
      POI treatment. Enrichment analyses were performed using the Database for 
      Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery database. The STRING database 
      and Cytoscape software were used for protein-protein interaction network 
      construction and core target identification. Finally, a molecular docking 
      analysis of the active components and core targets was performed. A total of 157 
      ingredients related to POI were identified. Enrichment analysis showed that these 
      components might participate in the mitogen-activated protein kinase, tumor 
      necrosis factor, phosphoinositide-3-kinase/AKT serine/threonine kinase 1, and 
      forkhead box O signaling pathways. Further protein-protein interaction network 
      analysis revealed that the core targets were Jun proto-oncogene, AKT 
      serine/threonine kinase 1, tumor protein P53, interleukin 6, and the epidermal 
      growth factor receptor. Molecular docking analysis showed that baicalein was the 
      most active ingredient with the highest affinity for the core targets. This study 
      identified baicalein as the core functional component and elucidated the 
      potential pharmacological effects of Kuntai capsule in the treatment of POI.

TI  - UHRF1 is essential for proper cytoplasmic architecture and function of mouse 
      oocytes and derived embryos.
LID - 10.26508/lsa.202301904 [doi]
LID - e202301904
AB  - Ubiquitin-like with PHD and RING finger domains 1 (UHRF1) is a protein essential 
      for the maintenance of DNA methylation in somatic cells. However, UHRF1 is 
      predominantly localized in the cytoplasm of mouse oocytes and preimplantation 
      embryos, where it may play a role unrelated to the nuclear function. We herein 
      report that oocyte-specific Uhrf1 KO results in impaired chromosome segregation, 
      abnormal cleavage division, and preimplantation lethality of derived embryos. Our 
      nuclear transfer experiment showed that the phenotype is attributable to 
      cytoplasmic rather than nuclear defects of the zygotes. A proteomic analysis of 
      KO oocytes revealed the down-regulation of proteins associated with microtubules 
      including tubulins, which occurred independently of transcriptomic changes. 
      Intriguingly, cytoplasmic lattices were disorganized, and mitochondria, 
      endoplasmic reticulum, and components of the subcortical maternal complex were 
      mislocalized. Thus, maternal UHRF1 regulates the proper cytoplasmic architecture 
      and function of oocytes and preimplantation embryos, likely through a mechanism 
      unrelated to DNA methylation.

AB  - The central amygdala (CeA) consists of numerous genetically defined inhibitory 
      neurons that control defensive and appetitive behaviors including feeding. 
      Transcriptomic signatures of cell types and their links to function remain poorly 
      understood. Using single-nucleus RNA sequencing, we describe nine CeA cell 
      clusters, of which four are mostly associated with appetitive and two with 
      aversive behaviors. To analyze the activation mechanism of appetitive CeA 
      neurons, we characterized serotonin receptor 2a (Htr2a)-expressing neurons 
      (CeA(Htr2a)) that comprise three appetitive clusters and were previously shown to 
      promote feeding. In vivo calcium imaging revealed that CeA(Htr2a) neurons are 
      activated by fasting, the hormone ghrelin, and the presence of food. Moreover, 
      these neurons are required for the orexigenic effects of ghrelin. Appetitive CeA 
      neurons responsive to fasting and ghrelin project to the parabrachial nucleus 
      (PBN) causing inhibition of target PBN neurons. These results illustrate how the 
      transcriptomic diversification of CeA neurons relates to fasting and 
      hormone-regulated feeding behavior.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A variety of high-throughput analyses, such as transcriptome, 
      proteome, and metabolome analysis, have been developed, producing unprecedented 
      amounts of omics data. These studies generate large gene lists, of which the 
      biological significance shall be deeply understood. However, manually 
      interpreting these lists is difficult, especially for non-bioinformatics-savvy 
      scientists. RESULTS: We developed an R package and a corresponding web 
      server-Genekitr, to assist biologists in exploring large gene sets. Genekitr 
      comprises four modules: gene information retrieval, ID (identifier) conversion, 
      enrichment analysis and publication-ready plotting. Currently, the information 
      retrieval module can retrieve information on up to 23 attributes for genes of 317 
      organisms. The ID conversion module assists in ID-mapping of genes, probes, 
      proteins, and aliases. The enrichment analysis module organizes 315 gene set 
      libraries in different biological contexts by over-representation analysis and 
      gene set enrichment analysis. The plotting module performs customizable and 
      high-quality illustrations that can be used directly in presentations or 
      publications. CONCLUSIONS: This web server tool will make bioinformatics more 
      accessible to scientists who might not have programming expertise, allowing them 
      to perform bioinformatics tasks without coding.

AB  - Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the primary histological form of lung cancer, 
      accounts for about 25%-the highest-of all cancer deaths. As NSCLC is often 
      undetected until symptoms appear in the late stages, it is imperative to discover 
      more effective tumor-associated biomarkers for early diagnosis. Topological data 
      analysis is one of the most powerful methodologies applicable to biological 
      networks. However, current studies fail to consider the biological significance 
      of their quantitative methods and utilize popular scoring metrics without 
      verification, leading to low performance. To extract meaningful insights from 
      genomic data, it is essential to understand the relationship between geometric 
      correlations and biological function mechanisms. Through bioinformatics and 
      network analyses, we propose a novel composite selection index, the C-Index, that 
      best captures significant pathways and interactions in gene networks to identify 
      biomarkers with the highest efficiency and accuracy. Furthermore, we establish a 
      4-gene biomarker signature that serves as a promising therapeutic target for 
      NSCLC and personalized medicine. The C-Index and biomarkers discovered were 
      validated with robust machine learning models. The methodology proposed for 
      finding top metrics can be applied to effectively select biomarkers and early 
      diagnose many diseases, revolutionizing the approach to topological network 
      research for all cancers.

      fibrosis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Fibrostenotic disease is a common complication in Crohn's disease 
      (CD) patients hallmarked by transmural extracellular matrix (ECM) accumulation in 
      the intestinal wall. The prevention and medical therapy of fibrostenotic CD is an 
      unmet high clinical need. Although targeting IL36R signaling is a promising 
      therapy option, downstream mediators of IL36 during inflammation and fibrosis 
      have been incompletely understood. Candidate molecules include matrix 
      metalloproteinases which mediate ECM turnover and are thereby potential targets 
      for anti-fibrotic treatment. Here, we have focused on understanding the role of 
      MMP13 during intestinal fibrosis. METHODS: We performed bulk RNA sequencing of 
      paired colon biopsies taken from non-stenotic and stenotic areas of patients with 
      CD. Corresponding tissue samples from healthy controls and CD patients with 
      stenosis were used for immunofluorescent (IF) staining. MMP13 gene expression was 
      analyzed in cDNA of intestinal biopsies from healthy controls and in 
      subpopulations of patients with CD in the IBDome cohort. In addition, gene 
      regulation on RNA and protein level was studied in colon tissue and primary 
      intestinal fibroblasts from mice upon IL36R activation or blockade. Finally, in 
      vivo studies were performed with MMP13 deficient mice and littermate controls in 
      an experimental model of intestinal fibrosis. Ex vivo tissue analysis included 
      Masson's Trichrome and Sirius Red staining as well as evaluation of immune cells, 
      fibroblasts and collagen VI by IF analysis. RESULTS: Bulk RNA sequencing revealed 
      high upregulation of MMP13 in colon biopsies from stenotic areas, as compared to 
      non-stenotic regions of patients with CD. IF analysis confirmed higher levels of 
      MMP13 in stenotic tissue sections of CD patients and demonstrated αSMA+ and Pdpn+ 
      fibroblasts as a major source. Mechanistic experiments demonstrated that MMP13 
      expression was regulated by IL36R signaling. Finally, MMP13 deficient mice, as 
      compared to littermate controls, developed less fibrosis in the chronic DSS model 
      and showed reduced numbers of αSMA+ fibroblasts. These findings are consistent 
      with a model suggesting a molecular axis involving IL36R activation in gut 
      resident fibroblasts and MMP13 expression during the pathogenesis of intestinal 
      fibrosis. CONCLUSION: Targeting IL36R-inducible MMP13 could evolve as a promising 
      approach to interfere with the development and progression of intestinal 
      fibrosis.

TI  - Genome-wide analysis of sex-specific differences in the mother-child PELAGIE 
      cohort exposed to organophosphate metabolites.

AB  - In recent decades, the detrimental effects of environmental contaminants on human 
      health have become a serious public concern. Organophosphate (OP) pesticides are 
      widely used in agriculture, and the negative impacts of OP and its metabolites on 
      human health have been demonstrated. We hypothesized that exposure to OPs during 
      pregnancy could impose damaging effects on the fetus by affecting various 
      processes. We analyzed sex-specific epigenetic responses in the placenta samples 
      obtained from the mother-child PELAGIE cohort. We assayed the telomere length and 
      mitochondrial copy numbers using genomic DNA. We analyzed H3K4me3 by using 
      chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by qPCR (ChIP‒qPCR) and high-throughput 
      sequencing (ChIP-seq). The human study was confirmed with mouse placenta tissue 
      analysis. Our study revealed a higher susceptibility of male placentas to OP 
      exposure. Specifically, we observed telomere length shortening and an increase in 
      γH2AX levels, a DNA damage marker. We detected lower histone H3K9me3 occupancy at 
      telomeres in diethylphosphate (DE)-exposed male placentas than in nonexposed 
      placentas. We found an increase in H3K4me3 occupancy at the promoters of thyroid 
      hormone receptor alpha (THRA), 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (OGG1) and 
      insulin-like growth factor (IGF2) in DE-exposed female placentas. H3K4me3 
      occupancy at PPARG was increased in both male and female placentas exposed to 
      dimethylphosphate (DM). The genome-wide sequencing of selected samples revealed 
      sex-specific differences induced by DE exposure. Specifically, we found 
      alterations in H3K4me3 in genes related to the immune system in female placenta 
      samples. In DE-exposed male placentas, a decrease in H3K4me3 occupancy at 
      development-related, collagen and angiogenesis-related genes was observed. 
      Finally, we observed a high number of NANOG and PRDM6 binding sites in regions 
      with altered histone occupancy, suggesting that the effects were possibly 
      mediated via these factors. Our data suggest that in utero exposure to 
      organophosphate metabolites affects normal placental development and could 
      potentially impact late childhood.

TI  - Interactive network pharmacology and electrochemical analysis reveals electron 
      transport-mediating characteristics of Chinese medicine formula Jing Guan Fang.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Jing Guan Fang (JGF) is an anti-COVID-19 Chinese Medicine decoction 
      comprised of five medicinal herbs to possess anti-inflammatory and antiviral 
      properties for treatment. This study aims to electrochemically decipher the 
      anti-coronavirus activity of JGF and show that microbial fuel cells may serve as 
      a platform for screening efficacious herbal medicines and providing scientific 
      bases for the mechanism of action (MOA) of TCMs. METHODS: Electrochemical 
      techniques (e.g., cyclic voltammetry) and MFCs were adopted as the 
      bioenergy-based platforms to assess the bioenergy-stimulating characteristics of 
      JGF. Phytochemical analysis correlated polyphenolic and flavonoid content with 
      antioxidant activity and bioenergy-stimulating properties. Network pharmacology 
      on the active compounds was employed to identify anti-inflammatory and 
      anti-COVID-19 protein targets, and molecular docking validated in silico results. 
      SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS: This first-attempt results show that JGF possesses 
      significant reversible bioenergy-stimulation (amplification 2.02 ± 0.04) 
      properties suggesting that its antiviral efficacy is both bioenergy-steered and 
      electron mediated. Major flavonoids and flavone glycosides identified by HPLC 
      (e.g., baicalein and baicalin, respectively) possess electron-shuttling (ES) 
      characteristics that allow herbal medicines to treat COVID-19 via (1) reversible 
      scavenging of ROS to lessen inflammation; (2) inhibition of viral proteins; and 
      (3) targeting of immunomodulatory pathways to stimulate the immune response 
      according to network pharmacology.

TI  - SOX1 Functions as a Tumor Suppressor by Repressing HES1 in Lung Cancer.
LID - 10.3390/cancers15082207 [doi]
LID - 2207
AB  - The development of lung cancer is a complex process that involves many genetic 
      and epigenetic changes. Sex-determining region Y (SRY)-box (SOX) genes encode a 
      family of proteins that are involved in the regulation of embryonic development 
      and cell fate determination. SOX1 is hypermethylated in human cancers. However, 
      the role of SOX1 in the development of lung cancer is unclear. We used 
      quantitative methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP), quantitative 
      reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis, and web tools 
      to confirm the frequent epigenetic silencing of SOX1 in lung cancer. Stable 
      overexpression of SOX1 repressed cell proliferation, anchorage-independent 
      growth, and invasion in vitro as well as cancer growth and metastasis in a 
      xenograft mouse model. Knockdown of SOX1 by the withdrawal of doxycycline partly 
      restored the malignant phenotype of inducible SOX1-expressing NSCLC cells. Next, 
      we discovered the potential downstream pathways of SOX1 using RNA-seq analysis 
      and identified HES1 as a direct target of SOX1 using chromatin 
      immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-PCR. Furthermore, we performed phenotypic rescue 
      experiments to prove that overexpression of HES1-FLAG in SOX1-expressing H1299 
      cells partly reversed the tumor-suppressive effect. Taken together, these data 
      demonstrated that SOX1 acts as a tumor suppressor by directly inhibiting HES1 
      during the development of NSCLC.

TI  - Circular RNA Expression Profiling by Microarray-A Technical and Practical 
      Perspective.
LID - 10.3390/biom13040679 [doi]
LID - 679
AB  - Circular RNAs, as covalently circularized RNA loops, have many unique biochemical 
      properties. Many circRNA biological functions and clinical indications are being 
      continually discovered. Increasingly, circRNAs are being used as a new class of 
      biomarkers, which are potentially superior to linear RNAs due to the unusual 
      cell/tissue/disease specificities and the exonuclease-resistant stabilized 
      circular form in the biofluids. Profiling circRNA expression has been a common 
      step in circRNA research to provide much needed insight into circRNA biology and 
      to facilitate rapid advances in the circRNA field. We will review circRNA 
      microarrays as a practical and effective circRNA profiling technology for 
      regularly equipped biological or clinical research labs, share valuable 
      experiences, and highlight the significant findings from the profiling studies.

TI  - Antiproliferative effect of selexipag active metabolite MRE-269 on pulmonary 
      arterial smooth muscle cells from patients with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary 
      hypertension.
PG  - e12231
LID - 10.1002/pul2.12231 [doi]
LID - e12231
AB  - Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) is a group 4 pulmonary 
      hypertension (PH) characterized by nonresolving thromboembolism in the central 
      pulmonary artery and vascular occlusion in the proximal and distal pulmonary 
      artery. Medical therapy is chosen for patients who are ineligible for pulmonary 
      endarterectomy or balloon pulmonary angioplasty or who have symptomatic residual 
      PH after surgery or intervention. Selexipag, an oral prostacyclin receptor 
      agonist and potent vasodilator, was approved for CTEPH in Japan in 2021. To 
      evaluate the pharmacological effect of selexipag on vascular occlusion in CTEPH, 
      we examined how its active metabolite MRE-269 affects platelet-derived growth 
      factor-stimulated pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) from CTEPH 
      patients. MRE-269 showed a more potent antiproliferative effect on PASMCs from 
      CTEPH patients than on those from normal subjects. DNA-binding protein inhibitor 
      (ID) genes ID1 and ID3 were found by RNA sequencing and real-time quantitative 
      polymerase chain reaction to be expressed at lower levels in PASMCs from CTEPH 
      patients than in those from normal subjects and were upregulated by MRE-269 
      treatment. ID1 and ID3 upregulation by MRE-269 was blocked by co-incubation with 
      a prostacyclin receptor antagonist, and ID1 knockdown by small interfering RNA 
      transfection attenuated the antiproliferative effect of MRE-269. ID signaling may 
      be involved in the antiproliferative effect of MRE-269 on PASMCs. This is the 
      first study to demonstrate the pharmacological effects on PASMCs from CTEPH 
      patients of a drug approved for the treatment of CTEPH. Both the vasodilatory and 
      the antiproliferative effect of MRE-269 may contribute to the efficacy of 
      selexipag in CTEPH.

AB  - Cancer-induced muscle wasting reduces quality of life, complicates or precludes 
      cancer treatments, and predicts early mortality. Herein, we investigate the 
      requirement of the muscle-specific E3 ubiquitin ligase, MuRF1, for muscle wasting 
      induced by pancreatic cancer. Murine pancreatic cancer (KPC) cells, or saline, 
      were injected into the pancreas of WT and MuRF1(-/-) mice, and tissues analyzed 
      throughout tumor progression. KPC tumors induces progressive wasting of skeletal 
      muscle and systemic metabolic reprogramming in WT mice, but not MuRF1(-/-) mice. 
      KPC tumors from MuRF1(-/-) mice also grow slower, and show an accumulation of 
      metabolites normally depleted by rapidly growing tumors. Mechanistically, MuRF1 
      is necessary for the KPC-induced increases in cytoskeletal and muscle contractile 
      protein ubiquitination, and the depression of proteins that support protein 
      synthesis. Together, these data demonstrate that MuRF1 is required for 
      KPC-induced skeletal muscle wasting, whose deletion reprograms the systemic and 
      tumor metabolome and delays tumor growth.

TI  - A Comprehensive Pan-Cancer Analysis Identifies CEP55 as a Potential Oncogene and 
      Novel Therapeutic Target.
LID - 10.3390/diagnostics13091613 [doi]
LID - 1613
AB  - Emerging research findings have shown that a centrosomal protein (CEP55) is a 
      potential oncogene in numerous human malignancies. Nevertheless, no pan-cancer 
      analysis has been conducted to investigate the various aspects and behavior of 
      this oncogene in different human cancerous tissues. Numerous databases were 
      investigated to conduct a detailed analysis of CEP55. Initially, we evaluated the 
      expression of CEP55 in several types of cancers and attempted to find the 
      correlation between that and the stage of the examined malignancies. Then, we 
      conducted a survival analysis to determine the relationship between CEP55 
      overexpression in malignancies and the patient's survival. Furthermore, we 
      examined the genetic alteration forms and the methylation status of this 
      oncogene. Additionally, the interference of CEP55 expression with immune cell 
      infiltration, the response to various chemotherapeutic agents, and the putative 
      molecular mechanism of CEP55 in tumorigenesis were investigated. The current 
      study found that CEP55 was upregulated in cancerous tissues versus normal 
      controls where this upregulation was correlated with a poor prognosis in multiple 
      forms of human cancers. Additionally, it influenced the level of different immune 
      cell infiltration and several chemokines levels in the tumor microenvironment in 
      addition to the response to several antitumor drugs. Herein, we provide an 
      in-depth understanding of the oncogenic activities of CEP55, identifying it as a 
      possible predictive marker as well as a specific target for developing anticancer 
      therapies.

TI  - Protein Networks Associated with Native Metabotropic Glutamate 1 Receptors 
      (mGlu(1)) in the Mouse Cerebellum.
LID - 10.3390/cells12091325 [doi]
LID - 1325
AB  - The metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (mGlu(1)) plays a pivotal role in synaptic 
      transmission and neuronal plasticity. Despite the fact that several interacting 
      proteins involved in the mGlu(1) subcellular trafficking and intracellular 
      transduction mechanisms have been identified, the protein network associated with 
      this receptor in specific brain areas remains largely unknown. To identify novel 
      mGlu(1)-associated protein complexes in the mouse cerebellum, we used an unbiased 
      tissue-specific proteomic approach, namely co-immunoprecipitation followed by 
      liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry analysis. Many well-known protein 
      complexes as well as novel interactors were identified, including G-proteins, 
      Homer, δ2 glutamate receptor, 14-3-3 proteins, and Na/K-ATPases. A novel putative 
      interactor, KCTD12, was further investigated. Reverse co-immunoprecipitation with 
      anti-KCTD12 antibodies revealed mGlu(1) in wild-type but not in KCTD12-knock-out 
      homogenates. Freeze-fracture replica immunogold labeling co-localization 
      experiments showed that KCTD12 and mGlu(1) are present in the same nanodomain in 
      Purkinje cell spines, although at a distance that suggests that this interaction 
      is mediated through interposed proteins. Consistently, mGlu(1) could not be 
      co-immunoprecipitated with KCTD12 from a recombinant mammalian cell line 
      co-expressing the two proteins. The possibility that this interaction was 
      mediated via GABA(B) receptors was excluded by showing that mGlu(1) and KCTD12 
      still co-immunoprecipitated from GABA(B) receptor knock-out tissue. In 
      conclusion, this study identifies tissue-specific mGlu(1)-associated protein 
      clusters including KCTD12 at Purkinje cell synapses.

TI  - Network Pharmacology and Molecular Docking Analysis of Active Compounds in 
      Tualang Honey against Atherosclerosis.
LID - 10.3390/foods12091779 [doi]
LID - 1779
AB  - Atherosclerosis, a pathological condition marked by the accumulation of lipids 
      and fibrous substances in the arterial walls, is a leading cause of heart failure 
      and death. The present study aimed to utilize network pharmacology to assess the 
      potential pharmacological effects of bioactive compounds in Tualang honey on 
      atherosclerosis. This is significant as previous studies have indicated the 
      cardioprotective effects of Tualang honey, yet a comprehensive evaluation using 
      network pharmacology has yet to be conducted. The bioactive compounds in Tualang 
      honey were screened and the potential gene targets for these compounds were 
      predicted through Swiss Target Prediction and SuperPred databases. 
      Atherosclerosis genes were retrieved from the OMIM, DisGeNet, and GeneCards 
      databases. The interaction between these compounds and atherosclerosis genes was 
      established through protein-protein interaction, gene ontology, and KEGG pathway 
      analysis. The results of these analyses were then further confirmed through 
      molecular docking studies using the AutoDock Tools software. The results revealed 
      that 6 out of 103 compounds in Tualang honey met the screening criteria, with a 
      total of 336 potential gene targets, 238 of which were shared with 
      atherosclerosis. Further analysis showed that these active compounds had a good 
      affinity with key targets and were associated with biological processes related 
      to protein phosphorylation and inflammation as well as pathways related to lipid 
      and atherosclerosis and other signaling pathways. In conclusion, the study 
      provides insight into the potential pharmacological effects of Tualang honey 
      bioactive compounds on atherosclerosis, supporting its use as a promising 
      treatment for the disease.

TI  - Methylation of lysine 36 on histone H3 is required to control transposon

AB  - Transposable elements constitute a substantial portion of most eukaryotic genomes 
      and their activity can lead to developmental and neuronal defects. In the 
      germline, transposon activity is antagonized by the PIWI-interacting RNA pathway 
      tasked with repression of transposon transcription and degrading transcripts that 
      have already been produced. However, most of the genes required for transposon 
      control are not expressed outside the germline, prompting the question: what 
      causes deleterious transposons activity in the soma and how is it managed? Here, 
      we show that disruptions of the Histone 3 lysine 36 methylation machinery led to 
      increased transposon transcription in Drosophila melanogaster brains and that 
      there is division of labour for the repression of transposable elements between 
      the different methyltransferases Set2, NSD, and Ash1. Furthermore, we show that 
      disruption of methylation leads to somatic activation of key genes in the 
      PIWI-interacting RNA pathway and the preferential production of RNA from 
      dual-strand piRNA clusters.

AB  - Acute lung injury (ALI) is characterized by an excessive inflammatory response. 
      Atractylodes lancea (Thunb.) DC. is a traditional chinese medicine with good 
      anti-inflammatory activity that is commonly used clinically for the treatment of 
      lung diseases in China; however, its mechanism of against ALI is unclear. We 
      clarified the therapeutic effects of ethanol extract of Atractylodis rhizoma 
      (EEAR) on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI by evaluation of hematoxylin-eosin 
      (HE) stained sections, the lung wet/dry (W/D) ratio, and levels of inflammatory 
      factors as indicators. We then characterized the chemical composition of EEAR by 
      ultra-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) and 
      screened the components and targets by network pharmacology to clarify the 
      signaling pathways involved in the therapeutic effects of EEAR on ALI, and the 
      results were validated by molecular docking simulation and Western blot (WB) 
      analysis. Finally, we examined the metabolites in rat lung tissues by gas 
      chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The results showed that EEAR 
      significantly reduced the W/D ratio, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), 
      interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels in the lungs of ALI model 
      rats. Nineteen components of EEAR were identified and shown to act synergetically 
      by regulating shared pathways such as the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) 
      and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-protein kinase B (AKT) signaling pathways. 
      Ferulic acid, 4-methylumbelliferone, acetylatractylodinol, atractylenolide I, and 
      atractylenolide III were predicted to bind well to PI3K, AKT and MAPK1, 
      respectively, with binding energies < -5 kcal/mol, although only atractylenolide 
      II bound with high affinity to MAPK1. EEAR significantly inhibited the 
      phosphorylation of PI3K, AKT, p38, and ERK1/2, thus reducing protein expression. 
      EEAR significantly modulated the expression of metabolites such as D-Galactose, 
      D-Glucose, serine and D-Mannose. These metabolites were mainly concentrated in 
      the galactose and amino acid metabolism pathways. In conclusion, EEAR alleviates 
      ALI by inhibiting activation of the PI3K-AKT and MAPK signaling pathways and 
      regulating galactose metabolism, providing a new direction for the development of 
      drugs to treat ALI.

LID - 106663
AB  - Hypospadias results from the impaired urethral development, which is influenced 
      by androgens, but its genetic etiology is still unknown. Through whole exome 
      sequencing analysis, we identified NR5A1, SRD5A2, and AR as mutational hotspots 
      in the etiology of severe hypospadias, as these genes are related to androgen 
      signaling. Additionally, rare damaging variants in cilia-related outer dynein arm 
      heavy chain (ODNAH) genes (DNAH5, DNAH8, DNAH9, DNAH11, and DNAH17) (p = 
      8.5 × 10(-47)) were significantly enriched in hypospadias cases. The Dnah8 KO 
      mice exhibited significantly decreased testosterone levels, which had an impact 
      on urethral development and disrupted steroid biosynthesis. Combined with trios 
      data, transcriptomic, and phenotypical and proteomic characterization of a mouse 
      model, our work links ciliary genes with hypospadias. Overall, a panel of ODNAH 
      genes with rare damaging variants was identified in 24% of hypospadias patients, 
      providing significant insights into the underlying pathogenesis of hypospadias as 
      well as genetic counseling.

TI  - METTL3 regulates alternative splicing of cell cycle-related genes via crosstalk 
      between mRNA m(6)A modifications and splicing factors.
PG  - 1443-1456
AB  - N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A) modification in RNA affects various aspects of RNA 
      metabolism and regulates gene expression. This modification is modulated by many 
      regulatory proteins, such as m(6)A methyltransferases (writers), m(6)A 
      demethylases (erasers), and m(6)A-binding proteins (readers). Previous studies 
      have suggested that alterations in m(6)A regulatory proteins induce genome-wide 
      alternative splicing in many cancer cells. However, the functional effects and 
      molecular mechanisms of m(6)A-mediated alternative splicing have not been fully 
      elucidated. To understand the consequences of this modification on RNA splicing 
      in cancer cells, we performed RNA sequencing and analyzed alternative splicing 
      patterns in METTL3-knockdown osteosarcoma U2OS cells. We detected 1,803 
      alternatively spliced genes in METTL3-knockdown cells compared to the controls 
      and found that cell cycle-related genes were enriched in differentially spliced 
      genes. A comparison of the published MeRIP-seq data for METTL14 with our RNA 
      sequencing data revealed that 70-87% of alternatively spliced genes had an m(6)A 
      peak near 1 kb of alternative splicing sites. Among the 19 RNA-binding proteins 
      enriched in alternative splicing sites, as revealed by motif analysis, expression 
      of SFPQ highly correlated with METTL3 expression in 12,839 TCGA pan-cancer 
      patients. We also found that cell cycle-related genes were enriched in 
      alternatively spliced genes of other cell lines with METTL3 knockdown. Taken 
      together, we suggest that METTL3 regulates m(6)A-dependent alternative splicing, 
      especially in cell cycle-related genes, by regulating the functions of splicing 
      factors such as SFPQ.

      therapeutics.
LID - 10.1007/s00011-023-01739-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive chronic 
      interstitial lung disease with limited therapeutic options. Cuproptosis is a 
      recently proposed novel form of programmed cell death, which has been strongly 
      implicated in the development of various human diseases. However, the prognostic 
      and therapeutic value of cuproptosis-related genes (CRGs) in IPF remains to be 
      elucidated. METHODS: In the present study, weighted gene co-expression network 
      analysis (WGCNA) was employed to identify the key CRGs associated with the 
      development of IPF. The subsequent GSEA, immune cell correlation analysis, and 
      single-cell RNA-Seq analysis were conducted to explore the potential role of the 
      identified CRGs in IPF. In addition, ROC curves and survival analysis were used 
      to assess the prognostic value of the key CRGs in IPF. Moreover, we explored the 
      molecular mechanisms of participation of identified key 
      CRGs in the development of pulmonary fibrogenesis through in vivo and 
      in vitro experiments. RESULTS: The expression level of cyclin-dependent kinase 
      inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A) is upregulated in the lung tissues of IPF patients and 
      associated with disease severity. Notably, CDKN2A was constitutively expressed by 
      fibrosis-promoting M2 macrophages. Decreased CDKN2A expression sensitizes M2 
      macrophages to elesclomol-induced cuproptosis in vitro. Inhibition of CDKN2A 
      decreases the number of viable macrophages and attenuates bleomycin-induced 
      pulmonary fibrosis in mice. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that CDKN2A 
      mediates the resistance of fibrosis-promoting M2 macrophages to cuproptosis and 
      promotes pulmonary fibrosis in mice. Our work provides fresh insights into CRGs 
      in IPF with potential value for research in the pathogenesis, 
      diagnosis, and a new therapy strategy for IPF.

TI  - ZNRF2 as an oncogene is transcriptionally regulated by CREB1 in breast cancer 
      models.
LID - 10.1007/s13577-023-00913-7 [doi]
AB  - E3 ubiquitin ligase Zinc and Ring Finger 2 (ZNRF2) has been demonstrated to be 
      engaged in the development of multiple cancers. Nevertheless, the function of 
      ZNRF2 in breast cancer (BC) still unclear. In this work, we firstly analyzed the 
      differentially expressed genes in BC by bioinformatics and found that ZNRF2 was 
      highly expressed in BC. Consistently, we further confirmed that ZNRF2 was 
      upregulated in BC tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues, and this was 
      positively correlated with the poor prognosis and the higher pathological grades 
      of patients with BC. Functional assays performed on HCC1937 and MCF-7 cells 
      indicated that silencing of ZNRF2 suppressed cell proliferation, as evidenced by 
      the decrease in the expression of cyclin A, PCNA and cyclin D1. Flow cytometry 
      and Hoechst staining showed that knockdown of ZNRF2 induced cell apoptosis, which 
      was verified by the upregulation of apoptosis genes such as Bax, cleaved PARP and 
      Bim. ZNRF2 knockdown also inhibited in vivo tumor growth. But, instead, 
      ZNRF2-overexpressed BC cells exhibited obvious malignant phenotypes. 
      Additionally, we observed that cAMP response element binding protein 1 (CREB1) 
      directly bound to the promoter sequence of ZNRF2 and thus activating its 
      transcription, suggesting that ZNRF2 is transcriptionally regulated by CREB1. 
      Additionally, ZNRF2 knockdown could reverse the proliferation-promoting action of 
      CREB1 on BC cells, Hence, this study demonstrated that ZNRF2 might serve as a 
      prospective therapeutic target for BC.

TI  - Therapeutic Effect of Costunolide in Autoimmune Hepatitis: Network Pharmacology 
      and Experimental Validation.
LID - 10.3390/ph16020316 [doi]
LID - 316
AB  - Novel treatments for autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) are highly demanded due to the 
      limitations of existing therapeutic agents. Costunolide is a promising candidate 
      due to its anti-inflammatory and hepatoprotective function, but its effect in AIH 
      remains obscure. In this study, we integrated network pharmacology and 
      experimental validation to reveal the effect and mechanism of costunolide in AIH. 
      A total of 73 common targets of costunolide and AIH were obtained from databases. 
      Pathway enrichment analysis indicated that PI3K-AKT pathway was the core pathway 
      of costunolide in AIH. Protein-protein interaction network analysis and molecular 
      docking revealed that SRC and IGF1R might play critical roles. In two murine AIH 
      models, costunolide significantly attenuated liver injury, inflammation, and 
      fibrosis reflected by the liver gross appearance, serum transaminases, necrosis 
      area, spleen index, immune cell infiltration, and collagen deposition. Western 
      blot and immunohistochemistry confirmed that phosphorylated AKT, SRC, and IGF1R 
      were upregulated in AIH models, and costunolide administration could inhibit the 
      phosphorylation of these proteins. In summary, costunolide significantly 
      ameliorates murine AIH. The therapeutic effect might work by suppressing the 
      activation of PI3K-AKT pathway and inhibiting the phosphorylation of SRC and 
      IGF1R. Our research reveals the potent therapeutic effect of costunolide in AIH 
      and the potential role of SRC and IGF1R in AIH for the first time, which may 
      further contribute to the novel drug development for AIH and other autoimmune 
      diseases.

LID - 10.1101/2023.04.26.538498 [doi]
AB  - The sheer complexity of the brain has complicated our ability to understand its 
      cellular mechanisms in health and disease. Genome-wide association studies have 
      uncovered genetic variants associated with specific neurological phenotypes and 
      diseases. In addition, single-cell transcriptomics have provided molecular 
      descriptions of specific brain cell types and the changes they undergo during 
      disease. Although these approaches provide a giant leap forward towards 
      understanding how genetic variation can lead to functional changes in the brain, 
      they do not establish molecular mechanisms. To address this need, we developed a 
      3D co-culture system termed iAssembloids (induced multi-lineage assembloids) that 
      enables the rapid generation of homogenous neuron-glia spheroids. We characterize 
      these iAssembloids with immunohistochemistry and single-cell transcriptomics and 
      combine them with large-scale CRISPRi-based screens. In our first application, we 
      ask how glial and neuronal cells interact to control neuronal death and survival. 
      Our CRISPRi-based screens identified that GSK3β inhibits the protective 
      NRF2-mediated oxidative stress response in the presence of reactive oxygen 
      species elicited by high neuronal activity, which was not previously found in 2D 
      monoculture neuron screens. We also apply the platform to investigate the role of 
      APOE-χ4, a risk variant for Alzheimer's Disease, in its effect on neuronal 
      survival. This platform expands the toolbox for the unbiased identification of 
      mechanisms of cell-cell interactions in brain health and disease.

TI  - P21 facilitates macrophage chemotaxis by promoting CCL7 in the lung epithelial 
      cell lines treated with radiation and bleomycin.
PG  - 314
LID - 10.1186/s12967-023-04177-5 [doi]

AB  - BACKGROUND: Interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) can be induced and even exacerbated 
      by radiotherapy in thoracic cancer patients. The roles of immune responses 
      underlying the development of these severe lung injuries are still obscure and 
      need to be investigated. METHODS: A severe lung damage murine model was 
      established by delivering 16 Gy X-rays to the chest of mice that had been 
      pre-treated with bleomycin (BLM) and thus hold ILDs. Bioinformatic analyses were 
      performed on the GEO datasets of radiation-induced lung injury (RILI) and 
      BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis (BIPF), and RNA-sequencing data of the severely 
      damaged lung tissues. The screened differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were 
      verified in lung epithelial cell lines by qRT-PCR assay. The injured lung tissue 
      pathology was analyzed with H&E and Masson's staining, and immunohistochemistry 
      staining. The macrophage chemotaxis and activity promoted by the stressed 
      epithelial cells were determined by using a cell co-culture system. The 
      expressions of p21 in MLE-12 and Beas-2B cells were detected by qRT-PCR, western 
      blot, and immunofluorescence. The concentration of CCL7 in cell supernatant was 
      measured by ELISA assay. In some experiments, Beas-2B cells were transfected with 
      p21-siRNA or CCL7-siRNA before irradiation and/or BLM treatment. RESULTS: After 
      the treatment of irradiation and/or BLM, the inflammatory and immune responses, 
      chemokine-mediated signaling pathways were steadily activated in the severely 
      injured lung, and p21 was screened out by the bioinformatic analysis and further 
      verified to be upregulated in both mouse and human lung epithelial cell lines. 
      The expression of P21 was positively correlated with macrophage infiltration in 
      the injured lung tissues. Co-culturing with stressed Beas-2B cells or its 
      conditioned medium containing CCL7 protein, U937 macrophages were actively 
      polarized to M1-phase and their migration ability was obviously increased along 
      with the damage degree of Beas-2B cells. Furthermore, knockdown p21 reduced CCL7 
      expression in Beas-2B cells and then decreased the chemotaxis of co-cultured 
      macrophages. CONCLUSIONS: P21 promoted CCL7 release from the severely injured 
      lung epithelial cell lines and contributed to the macrophage chemotaxis in vitro, 
      which provides new insights for better understanding the inflammatory responses 
      in lung injury.

AB  - Pancreatic cancer is the seventh most prevalent cause of mortality globally. 
      Since time immemorial, plant-derived products have been in use as therapeutic 
      agents due to the existence of biologically active molecules called secondary 
      metabolites. Flavonoids obtained from plants participate in cell cycle arrest, 
      induce autophagy and apoptosis, and decrease oxidative stress in pancreatic 
      cancer. The present study involves network pharmacology-based study of the 
      methanolic leaf extract of Trema orientalis (MLETO) Linn. From the 
      high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) analysis, 21 nucleated flavonoids were 
      screened out, of which only apigeniflavan was selected for further studies 
      because it followed Lipinski's rule and showed no toxicity. The pharmacokinetics 
      and physiochemical characteristics of apigeniflavan were performed using the 
      online web servers pkCSM, Swiss ADME, and ProTox-II. This is the first in silico 
      study to report the efficiency of apigeniflavan in pancreatic cancer treatment. 
      The targets of apigeniflavan were fetched from SwissTargetPrediction database. 
      The targets of pancreatic cancer were retrieved from DisGeNET and GeneCards. The 
      protein-protein interaction of the common genes using Cytoscape yielded the top 
      five hub genes: KDR, VEGFA, AKT1, SRC, and ESR1. Upon molecular docking, the 
      lowest binding energies corresponded to best docking score which indicated the 
      highest protein-ligand affinity. Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) 
      database was employed to see the involvement of hub genes in pathways related to 
      pancreatic cancer. The following, pancreatic cancer pathway, MAPK, VEGF, 
      PI3K-Akt, and ErbB signaling pathways, were found to be significant. Our results 
      indicate the involvement of the hub genes in tumor growth, invasion and 
      proliferation in the above-mentioned pathways, and therefore necessitating their 
      downregulation. Moreover, apigeniflavan can flourish as a promising drug for the 
      treatment of pancreatic cancer in future.

TI  - Exploring the mechanism by which quercetin re-sensitizes breast cancer to 
      paclitaxel: network pharmacology, molecular docking, and experimental 
      verification.
LID - 10.1007/s00210-023-02510-9 [doi]
AB  - This study is aimed to explore the potential molecular mechanism of quercetin 
      reversing paclitaxel (PTX) resistance in breast cancer (BC) by network 
      pharmacology, molecular docking, and experimental verification. Pharmacological 
      platform databases are used to predict quercetin targets and BC PTX-resistance 
      genes and constructed the expression profile of quercetin chemosensitization. The 
      overlapping targets were input into the STRING database and used Cytoscape v3.9.0 
      to construct the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. Subsequently, these 
      targets were performed with Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes 
      and Genomes (KEGG) functional enrichment analyses and molecular docking. Finally, 
      we further detected the potential role of quercetin in improving PTX sensitivity 
      in BC in vitro experiments. Compounds and targets screening hinted that 220 
      quercetin predicted targets, 244 BC PTX resistance-related genes, and 66 
      potential sensitive target genes (PSTGs). Network pharmacology screening revealed 
      the top-15 crucial targets in PPI network of quercetin reversing the sensitivity 
      of BC to PTX. KEGG analysis revealed that they were mainly enriched in the 
      EGFR/ERK signaling pathway. Molecular docking showed that both quercetin and PTX 
      could stably bind to the key targets in the EGFR/ERK signaling pathway. In vitro 
      experiments further confirmed that quercetin inhibited the key targets in the 
      EGFR/ERK axis to the suppression of cell proliferation and promotion of apoptosis 
      in PTX-resistance BC cells, and restoring the activity of the resistant cells to 
      PTX. Our results suggested that quercetin increased the sensitivity of BC to PTX 
      through inhibiting EGFR/ERK axis, and it is an effective treatment for reversing 
      PTX resistance.

TI  - Differences in the urinary metabolome and proteome between wet and dry nights in 
      children with monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis and nocturnal polyuria.
LID - 10.1007/s00467-023-05963-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nocturnal enuresis (NE) is a common disease with multiple pathogenic 
      mechanisms. This study aimed to compare levels of metabolites and proteins 
      between wet and dry nights in urine samples from children with monosymptomatic NE 
      (MNE). METHODS: Ten boys with MNE and nocturnal polyuria (age: 7.6 ± 1.3 years) 
      collected their total nighttime urine production during a wet and a dry night. 
      Untargeted metabolomics and proteomics were performed on the urine samples by 
      liquid chromatography coupled with high-mass accuracy tandem mass spectrometry 
      (LC-MS/MS). RESULTS: On wet nights, we found reduced urine osmolality (P = 0.025) 
      and increased excretion of urinary potassium and sodium by a factor of, 
      respectively, 2.1 (P = 0.038) and 1.9 (P = 0.19) compared with dry nights. LC-MS 
      identified 59 metabolites and 84 proteins with significantly different levels 
      between wet and dry nights (fold change (FC) < 0.67 or > 1.5, P < 0.05). Some 
      compounds were validated by different methodologies. During wet nights, levels of 
      compounds related to oxidative stress and blood pressure, including adrenalin, 
      were increased. We found reduced levels of aquaporin-2 on wet nights. The FCs in 
      the 59 metabolites were positively correlated to the FCs in the same metabolites 
      identified in urine samples obtained during the evening preceding wet and dry 
      nights. CONCLUSIONS: Oxidative stress, which in the literature has been 
      associated with nocturia and disturbances in sleep, might be increased during wet 
      nights in children with MNE. We further found evidence of increased sympathetic 
      activity. The mechanisms related to having wet nights in children with MNE seem 
      complex, and both free water and solute handling appear to be important. A higher 
      resolution version of the Graphical abstract is available as Supplementary 
      information.

TI  - Evolutionary Trajectories of New Duplicated and Putative De Novo Genes.
LID - 10.1093/molbev/msad098 [doi]
LID - msad098
AB  - The formation of new genes during evolution is an important motor of functional 
      innovation, but the rate at which new genes originate and the likelihood that 
      they persist over longer evolutionary periods are still poorly understood 
      questions. Two important mechanisms by which new genes arise are gene duplication 
      and de novo formation from a previously noncoding sequence. Does the mechanism of 
      formation influence the evolutionary trajectories of the genes? Proteins arisen 
      by gene duplication retain the sequence and structural properties of the parental 
      protein, and thus they may be relatively stable. Instead, de novo originated 
      proteins are often species specific and thought to be more evolutionary labile. 
      Despite these differences, here we show that both types of genes share a number 
      of similarities, including low sequence constraints in their initial evolutionary 
      phases, high turnover rates at the species level, and comparable persistence 
      rates in deeper branchers, in both yeast and flies. In addition, we show that 
      putative de novo proteins have an excess of substitutions between charged amino 
      acids compared with the neutral expectation, which is reflected in the rapid loss 
      of their initial highly basic character. The study supports high evolutionary 
      dynamics of different kinds of new genes at the species level, in sharp contrast 
      with the stability observed at later stages.

      and metastatic midbrain tumors. Here, 56-male-Wistar rats were divided into eight 
      groups: Normal group, Midbrain Tomur Model group, Model + Exe group, 
      Model + Lipo, Model + Extract, Model + Lipo-Extract, Model + Extract-Exe, 
      Model + Lipo-Extract + Exe. According to the aim, mid-brain tumor models were 
      conducted by injections of the C6 glioma cell line (5 × 10(5) cell suspension) 
      and stereotaxic techniques in the substantia nigra area. Furthermore, consumption 
      of nanoformulation of herbals extract (100 mg/kg/day), crude extract 
      (100 mg/kg/day), and swimming training (30 min, 3 days/week) as interventional 
      protocols were performed for 6 weeks. In addition, we evaluated the effect of 
      polyherbal nanoliposomes containing four plant extracts and swimming training on 
      the GABArα1/TRKB/DRD2/DRD1a/TH network in the substantia nigra of the midbrain 
      tumor rat model. Data emphasized that DRD2 might be a druggable protein with the 
      network's highest significance cut-point effect that could modulate sensory-motor 
      impairment. Furthermore, we found Quercetin, Ginsenosides, Curcumin, and Rutin, 
      as bioactive compounds present in Ginseng, Matthiola incana, Turmeric, and 
      Green-Tea extracts, could bind over the DRD2 protein with approved binding 
      affinity scores. Based on our data, swimming training, and nanoliposome-enriched 
      combined supplements could consider effective complementary medicine for motor 
      impairment recovery induced by the midbrain tumor in the substantia nigra area. 
      Hence, regular swimming training and natural medicines rich in polyphenolic 
      bioactive components and antioxidative effects could modify and improve the 
      dopamine receptors' function. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The online version

AB  - Gene regulatory networks within cells modulate the expression of the genome in 
      response to signals and changing environmental conditions. Reconstructions of 
      gene regulatory networks can reveal the information processing and control 
      principles used by cells to maintain homeostasis and execute cell-state 
      transitions. Here, we introduce a computational framework, D-SPIN, that generates 
      quantitative models of gene-regulatory networks from single-cell mRNA-seq data 
      sets collected across thousands of distinct perturbation conditions. D-SPIN 
      models the cell as a collection of interacting gene-expression programs, and 
      constructs a probabilistic model to infer regulatory interactions between 
      gene-expression programs and external perturbations. Using large Perturb-seq and 
      drug-response datasets, we demonstrate that D-SPIN models reveal the organization 
      of cellular pathways, sub-functions of macromolecular complexes, and the logic of 
      cellular regulation of transcription, translation, metabolism, and protein 
      degradation in response to gene knockdown perturbations. D-SPIN can also be 
      applied to dissect drug response mechanisms in heterogeneous cell populations, 
      elucidating how combinations of immunomodulatory drugs can induce novel cell 
      states through additive recruitment of gene expression programs. D-SPIN provides 
      a computational framework for constructing interpretable models of 
      gene-regulatory networks to reveal principles of cellular information processing 
      and physiological control.

TI  - Differential Contributions of Distinct Free Radical Peroxidation Mechanisms to 
      the Induction of Ferroptosis.
PG  - 1100-1117
LID - 10.1021/jacsau.2c00681 [doi]
AB  - Ferroptosis is a form of regulated cell death driven by lipid peroxidation of 
      polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Lipid peroxidation can propagate through 
      either the hydrogen-atom transfer (HAT) or peroxyl radical addition (PRA) 
      mechanism. However, the contribution of the PRA mechanism to the induction of 
      ferroptosis has not been studied. In this study, we aim to elucidate the 
      relationship between the reactivity and mechanisms of lipid peroxidation and 
      ferroptosis induction. We found that while some peroxidation-reactive lipids, 
      such as 7-dehydrocholesterol, vitamins D(3) and A, and coenzyme Q10, suppress 
      ferroptosis, both nonconjugated and conjugated PUFAs enhanced cell death induced 
      by RSL3, a ferroptosis inducer. Importantly, we found that conjugated PUFAs, 
      including conjugated linolenic acid (CLA 18:3) and conjugated linoleic acid (CLA 
      18:2), can induce or potentiate ferroptosis much more potently than nonconjugated 
      PUFAs. We next sought to elucidate the mechanism underlying the different 
      ferroptosis-inducing potency of conjugated and nonconjugated PUFAs. Lipidomics 
      revealed that conjugated and nonconjugated PUFAs are incorporated into distinct 
      cellular lipid species. The different peroxidation mechanisms predict the 
      formation of higher levels of reactive electrophilic aldehydes from conjugated 
      PUFAs than nonconjugated PUFAs, which was confirmed by aldehyde-trapping and mass 
      spectrometry. RNA sequencing revealed that protein processing in the endoplasmic 
      reticulum and proteasome are among the most significantly upregulated pathways in 
      cells treated with CLA 18:3, suggesting increased ER stress and activation of 
      unfolded protein response. These results suggest that protein damage by lipid 
      electrophiles is a key step in ferroptosis.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The metalloprotease ADAM17 (also called TACE) plays fundamental roles 
      in homeostasis by shedding key signaling molecules from the cell surface. 
      Although its importance for the immune system and epithelial tissues is 
      well-documented, little is known about the role of ADAM17 in metabolic 
      homeostasis. The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of ADAM17 
      expression, specifically in adipose tissues, on metabolic homeostasis. METHODS: 
      We used histopathology, molecular, proteomic, transcriptomic, in vivo integrative 
      physiological and ex vivo biochemical approaches to determine the impact of 
      adipose tissue-specific deletion of ADAM17 upon adipocyte and whole organism 
      metabolic physiology. RESULTS: ADAM17(adipoq-creΔ/Δ) mice exhibited a 
      hypermetabolic phenotype characterized by elevated energy consumption and 
      increased levels of adipocyte thermogenic gene expression. On a high fat diet, 
      these mice were more thermogenic, while exhibiting elevated expression levels of 
      genes associated with lipid oxidation and lipolysis. This hypermetabolic 
      phenotype protected mutant mice from obesogenic challenge, limiting weight gain, 
      hepatosteatosis and insulin resistance. Activation of beta-adrenoceptors by the 
      neurotransmitter norepinephrine, a key regulator of adipocyte physiology, 
      triggered the shedding of ADAM17 substrates, and regulated ADAM17 expression at 
      the mRNA and protein levels, hence identifying a functional connection between 
      thermogenic licensing and the regulation of ADAM17. Proteomic studies identified 
      Semaphorin 4B (SEMA4B), as a novel ADAM17-shed adipokine, whose expression is 
      regulated by physiological thermogenic cues, that acts to inhibit adipocyte 
      differentiation and dampen thermogenic responses in adipocytes. Transcriptomic 
      data showed that cleaved SEMA4B acts in an autocrine manner in brown adipocytes 
      to repress the expression of genes involved in adipogenesis, thermogenesis, and 
      lipid uptake, storage and catabolism. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings identify a novel 
      ADAM17-dependent axis, regulated by beta-adrenoceptors and mediated by the 
      ADAM17-cleaved form of SEMA4B, that modulates energy balance in adipocytes by 
      inhibiting adipocyte differentiation, thermogenesis and lipid catabolism.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This study was aimed to identify key ferroptosis-related biomarkers 
      in steroid-induced osteonecrosis of the femoral head (SONFH) based on machine 
      learning algorithm. METHODS: The SONFH dataset GSE123568 (including 30 SONFH 
      patients and 10 controls) was used in this study. The differentially expressed 
      genes (DEGs) were selected between SONFH and control groups, which were subjected 
      to WGCNA. Ferroptosis-related genes were downloaded from FerrDb V2, which were 
      then compared with DEGs and module genes. Two machine learning algorithms were 
      utilized to identify key ferroptosis-related genes, and the underlying mechanisms 
      were analyzed by GSEA. Correlation analysis between key ferroptosis-related genes 
      and immune cells was analyzed by Spearman method. The drug-gene relationships 
      were predicted in CTD. RESULTS: Total 2030 DEGs were obtained. WGCNA identified 
      two key modules and obtained 1561 module genes. Finally, 43 intersection genes 
      were identified as disease-related ferroptosis-related genes. After LASSO 
      regression and RFE-SVM algorithms, 4 intersection genes (AKT1S1, BACH1, MGST1 and 
      SETD1B) were considered as key ferroptosis-related gene. The 4 genes were 
      correlated with osteoclast differentiation pathway. Twenty immune cells with 
      significant differences were obtained between the groups, and the 4 key 
      ferroptosis-related genes were correlated with most immune cells. In CTD, 41 
      drug-gene relationship pairs were finally obtained. CONCLUSIONS: The 4 key 
      ferroptosis-related genes, AKT1S1, BACH1, MGST1 and SETD1B, were identified to 
      play a critical role in SONFH progression through osteoclast differentiation and 
      immunologic mechanisms. Additionally, all the 4 genes had good disease prediction 
      effect and could act as biomarkers for the diagnosis and treatment of SONFH.

AB  - Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) play a key role in tumor metastasis. CTCs have 
      altered gene expression and can survive in the bloodstream. Finding the key genes 
      whose expression are altered in CTCs could help explain the mechanism of tumor 
      metastasis. We searched for genes differentially expressed in CTCs by analyzing 
      four CTCs and primary tumor gene expression datasets in the GEO database. Key 
      genes of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) CTCs were identified. The 
      correlation between key genes and the immune microenvironment of ccRCC was 
      explored. Finally, the CTCs cell model of ccRCC was constructed by in vivo 
      screening method, and the expression of key genes was detected at the cell and 
      tissue levels. A total of 771 DEGs were obtained. Gene enrichment analysis showed 
      that DEGs of CTCs were mainly involved in the regulation of the tumor immune 
      process and tumor cell apoptosis. Finally, we found 2 key genes, MMP9 and TYROBP 
      in ccRCC CTCs. The high expression of these 2 genes predicted a poor prognosis of 
      ccRCC, and the expression levels of these 2 genes were significantly increased in 
      CTCs and ccRCC tissues. Our study suggested that genetic alterations in CTCs 
      contribute to the ability of CTCs to survive in the blood by adapting to the 
      tumor microenvironment. MMP9 and TYROBP are potential therapeutic and prognostic 
      targets for ccRCC.

TI  - A Novel Derivative of Curcumol, HCL-23, Inhibits the Malignant Phenotype of 
      Triple-Negative Breast Cancer and Induces Apoptosis and HO-1-Dependent 
      Ferroptosis.
LID - 10.3390/molecules28083389 [doi]

AB  - Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive molecular subtype of 
      breast cancer. Curcumol, as a natural small molecule compound, has potential 
      anti-breast cancer activity. In this study, we chemically synthesized a 
      derivative of curcumol, named HCL-23, by structural modification and explored its 
      effect on and underlying mechanism regarding TNBC progression. MTT and colony 
      formation assays demonstrated that HCL-23 significantly inhibited TNBC cells 
      proliferation. HCL-23 induced G2/M phase cell cycle arrest and repressed the 
      capability of migration, invasion, and adhesion in MDA-MB-231 cells. RNA-seq 
      results identified 990 differentially expressed genes including 366 upregulated 
      and 624 downregulated genes. Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and 
      Genomes (KEGG), and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) revealed that these 
      differentially expressed genes were obviously enriched in adhesion, cell 
      migration, apoptosis, and ferroptosis. Furthermore, HCL-23 induced apoptosis via 
      the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and the activation of the caspase 
      family in TNBC cells. In addition, HCL-23 was verified to trigger ferroptosis 
      through increasing cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), labile iron pool 
      (LIP), and lipid peroxidation levels. Mechanistically, HCL-23 markedly 
      upregulated the expression of heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1), and the knockdown of HO-1 
      could attenuate ferroptosis induced by HCL-23. In animal experiments, we found 
      that HCL-23 inhibited tumor growth and weight. Consistently, the upregulation of 
      Cleaved Caspase-3, Cleaved PARP, and HO-1 expression was also observed in tumor 
      tissues treated with HCL-23. In summary, the above results suggest that HCL-23 
      can promote cell death through activating caspases-mediated apoptosis and 
      HO-1-dependent ferroptosis in TNBC. Therefore, our findings provide a new 
      potential agent against TNBC.

TI  - Transcriptomic Analysis of Acetaminophen Biodegradation by Penicillium

      Pathways.
LID - 10.3390/jof9040408 [doi]

AB  - (1) Background: Acetaminophen (APAP), an active component of many analgesic and 
      antipyretic drugs, is one of the most concerning trace contaminants in the 
      environment and is considered as an emergent pollutant of marine and aquatic 
      ecosystems. Despite its biodegradability, APAP has become a recalcitrant compound 
      due to the growth of the global population, the ease of availability, and the 
      inefficient wastewater treatment applied. (2) Methods: In this study, we used a 
      transcriptomic approach to obtain functional and metabolic insights about the 
      metabolization of APAP by a phenol-degrading fungal strain, Penicillium 
      chrysogenum var. halophenolicum. (3) Results: We determined that the 
      transcriptomic profile exhibited by the fungal strain during APAP degradation was 
      very dynamic, being characterized by an abundance of dysregulated transcripts 
      which were proportional to the drug metabolization. Using a systems biology 
      approach, we also inferred the protein functional interaction networks that could 
      be related to APAP degradation. We proposed the involvement of intracellular and 
      extracellular enzymes, such as amidases, cytochrome P450, laccases, and 
      extradiol-dioxygenases, among others. (4) Conclusions: Our data suggested that 
      the fungus could metabolize APAP via a complex metabolic pathway, generating 
      nontoxic metabolites, which demonstrated its potential in the bioremediation of 
      this drug.

TI  - Identifying Natural Bioactive Peptides from the Common Octopus (Octopus vulgaris 
      Cuvier, 1797) Skin Mucus By-Products Using Proteogenomic Analysis.
LID - 10.3390/ijms24087145 [doi]
LID - 7145
AB  - The common octopus is a cephalopod species subject to active fisheries, with 
      great potential in the aquaculture and food industry, and which serves as a model 
      species for biomedical and behavioral studies. The analysis of the skin mucus 
      allows us to study their health in a non-invasive way, by using a hardly 
      exploited discard of octopus in the fishing sector. A shotgun proteomics approach 
      combined with liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry 
      (LC-MS/MS) using an Orbitrap-Elite instrument was used to create a reference 
      dataset from octopus skin mucus. The final proteome compilation was investigated 
      by integrated in-silico studies, including Gene Ontology (GO), the Kyoto 
      Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway, network studies, and prediction 
      and characterization analysis of potential bioactive peptides. This work presents 
      the first proteomic analysis of the common octopus skin mucus proteome. This 
      library was created by merging 5937 identified spectra of 2038 different 
      peptides. A total of 510 non-redundant proteins were identified. Obtained results 
      show proteins closely related to the defense, which highlight the role of skin 
      mucus as the first barrier of defense and the interaction with the environment. 
      Finally, the potential of the bioactive peptides with antimicrobial properties, 
      and their possible application in biomedicine, pharmaceutical, and nutraceutical 
      industry was addressed.

TI  - The Potential Regulation of A-to-I RNA Editing on Genes in Parkinson's Disease.
LID - 10.3390/genes14040919 [doi]
LID - 919
AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by dopaminergic neurodegeneration and 
      an abnormal accumulation of α-synuclein aggregates. A number of genetic factors 
      have been shown to increase the risk of PD. Exploring the underlying molecular 
      mechanisms that mediate PD's transcriptomic diversity can help us understand 
      neurodegenerative pathogenesis. In this study, we identified 9897 A-to-I RNA 
      editing events associated with 6286 genes across 372 PD patients. Of them, 72 RNA 
      editing events altered miRNA binding sites and this may directly affect miRNA 
      regulations of their host genes. However, RNA editing effects on the miRNA 
      regulation of genes are more complex. They can (1) abolish existing miRNA binding 
      sites, which allows miRNAs to regulate other genes; (2) create new miRNA binding 
      sites that may sequester miRNAs from regulating other genes; or (3) occur in the 
      miRNA seed regions and change their targets. The first two processes are also 
      referred to as miRNA competitive binding. In our study, we found 8 RNA editing 
      events that may alter the expression of 1146 other genes via miRNA competition. 
      We also found one RNA editing event that modified a miRNA seed region, which was 
      predicted to disturb the regulation of four genes. Considering the PD-related 
      functions of the affected genes, 25 A-to-I RNA editing biomarkers for PD are 
      proposed, including the 3 editing events in the EIF2AK2, APOL6, and miR-4477b 
      seed regions. These biomarkers may alter the miRNA regulation of 133 PD-related 
      genes. All these analyses reveal the potential mechanisms and regulations of RNA 
      editing in PD pathogenesis.

TI  - Integration of Chemoinformatics and Multi-Omics Analysis Defines ECT2 as a 
      Potential Target for Cancer Drug Therapy.
LID - 10.3390/biology12040613 [doi]
LID - 613
AB  - Epithelial cell transforming 2 (ECT2) is a potential oncogene and a number of 
      recent studies have correlated it with the progression of several human cancers. 
      Despite this elevated attention for ECT2 in oncology-related reports, there is no 
      collective study to combine and integrate the expression and oncogenic behavior 
      of ECT2 in a panel of human cancers. The current study started with a 
      differential expression analysis of ECT2 in cancerous versus normal tissue. 
      Following that, the study asked for the correlation between ECT2 upregulation and 
      tumor stage, grade, and metastasis, along with its effect on patient survival. 
      Moreover, the methylation and phosphorylation status of ECT2 in tumor versus 
      normal tissue was assessed, in addition to the investigation of the ECT2 effect 
      on the immune cell infiltration in the tumor microenvironment. The current study 
      revealed that ECT2 was upregulated as mRNA and protein levels in a list of human 
      tumors, a feature that allowed for the increased filtration of myeloid-derived 
      suppressor cells (MDSC) and decreased the level of natural killer T (NKT) cells, 
      which ultimately led to a poor prognosis survival. Lastly, we screened for 
      several drugs that could inhibit ECT2 and act as antitumor agents. Collectively, 
      this study nominated ECT2 as a prognostic and immunological biomarker, with 
      reported inhibitors that represent potential antitumor drugs.

TI  - Secretome Screening of BRAFV600E-Mutated Colon Cancer Cells Resistant to 
      Vemurafenib.
LID - 10.3390/biology12040608 [doi]
LID - 608
AB  - Patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) carrying BRAFV600E mutation 
      have worse response to chemotherapy and poor prognosis. The BRAFV600E inhibitor 
      vemurafenib has shown modest efficacy as monotherapy in BRAF-mutated mCRC due to 
      the development of resistance. The aim of this study was to conduct a comparative 
      proteomics profiling of the secretome from vemurafenib-sensitive vs. -resistant 
      colon cancer cells harboring BRAFV600E mutation in order to identify specific 
      secretory features potentially associated with changes in the resistant cells' 
      phenotype. Towards this aim, we employed two complementary proteomics approaches 
      including two-dimensional gel electrophoresis coupled with MALDI-TOF/TOF mass 
      spectrometry and label-free quantitative LC-MS/MS analysis. Obtained results 
      pointed to aberrant regulation of DNA replication and endoplasmic reticulum 
      stress as the major secretome features associated with chemoresistant phenotype. 
      Accordingly, two proteins implicated in these processes including RPA1 and 
      HSPA5/GRP78 were discussed in more details in the context of biological networks 
      and their importance as potential secretome targets for further functional and 
      clinical evaluation. Expression patterns of RPA1 and HSPA5/GRP78 in tumor tissues 
      from colon cancer patients were also found in additional in silico analyses to be 
      associated with BRAFV600E mutation status, which opens the possibility to 
      extrapolate our findings and their clinical implication to other solid tumors 
      harboring BRAFV600E mutation, such as melanoma.

TI  - Inulin diet uncovers complex diet-microbiota-immune cell interactions remodeling 
      the gut epithelium.
PG  - 90
LID - 10.1186/s40168-023-01520-2 [doi]
LID - 90
AB  - BACKGROUND: The continuous proliferation of intestinal stem cells followed by 
      their tightly regulated differentiation to epithelial cells is essential for the 
      maintenance of the gut epithelial barrier and its functions. How these processes 
      are tuned by diet and gut microbiome is an important, but poorly understood 
      question. Dietary soluble fibers, such as inulin, are known for their ability to 
      impact the gut bacterial community and gut epithelium, and their consumption has 
      been usually associated with health improvement in mice and humans. In this 
      study, we tested the hypothesis that inulin consumption modifies the composition 
      of colonic bacteria and this impacts intestinal stem cells functions, thus 
      affecting the epithelial structure. METHODS: Mice were fed with a diet containing 
      5% of the insoluble fiber cellulose or the same diet enriched with an additional 
      10% of inulin. Using a combination of histochemistry, host cell transcriptomics, 
      16S microbiome analysis, germ-free, gnotobiotic, and genetically modified mouse 
      models, we analyzed the impact of inulin intake on the colonic epithelium, 
      intestinal bacteria, and the local immune compartment. RESULTS: We show that the 
      consumption of inulin diet alters the colon epithelium by increasing the 
      proliferation of intestinal stem cells, leading to deeper crypts and longer 
      colons. This effect was dependent on the inulin-altered gut microbiota, as no 
      modulations were observed in animals deprived of microbiota, nor in mice fed 
      cellulose-enriched diets. We also describe the pivotal role of γδ T lymphocytes 
      and IL-22 in this microenvironment, as the inulin diet failed to induce 
      epithelium remodeling in mice lacking this T cell population or cytokine, 
      highlighting their importance in the diet-microbiota-epithelium-immune system 
      crosstalk. CONCLUSION: This study indicates that the intake of inulin affects the 
      activity of intestinal stem cells and drives a homeostatic remodeling of the 
      colon epithelium, an effect that requires the gut microbiota, γδ T cells, and the 
      presence of IL-22. Our study indicates complex cross kingdom and cross cell type 
      interactions involved in the adaptation of the colon epithelium to the luminal 
      environment in steady state. Video Abstract.

LID - 10.5187/jast.2022.e110 [doi]
AB  - Beef consumers valued meat quality traits such as texture, tenderness, juiciness, 
      flavor, and meat color that determining consumers' purchasing decision. Most 
      research on meat quality has focused on marbling, a key characteristic related to 
      meat eating quality. However, other important traits such as meat texture, 
      tenderness, and color have not much studied in cattle. Among these traits, meat 
      tenderness and texture of cattle are among the most important factors affecting 
      quality evaluation of consumers. Collagen is the main component of connective 
      tissues.It greatly affects meat tenderness. The objective of this study was to 
      determine significant variants and candidate genes associated with collagen 
      contents trait (total collagen) through genome-wide association studies (GWAS). 
      Phenotypic and genomic data from 135 Hanwoo were used. The BLUPF90 family program 
      and GRAMMAR method for GWAS were applied in this study. A total of 73 potential 
      single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) showed significant associations with 
      collagen content. They were located in or near 108 candidate genes. TMEM135 and 
      ME3 genes were identified to have the most significant SNPs associated with 
      collagen contents trait. Data indicated that these genes were related to 
      collagen. Biological processes and pathways for the prediction of biological 
      functions of candidate genes were confirmed. We found that candidate genes were 
      involved in positive regulation of CREB transcription factor activity and actin 
      cytoskeleton related to tenderness and texture of beef. Three genes (CRTC3, MYO1C 
      and MYLK4) belonging to these biological functions were related to tenderness. 
      These results provide a basis for improving genomic characteristics of Hanwoo for 
      the production of tender beef. Furthermore, they could be used they could be used 
      as an index to select desired traits for consumers.

TI  - Shotgun Proteomics of Co-Cultured Leukemic and Bone Marrow Stromal Cells from 
      Different Species as a Preliminary Approach to Detect Intercellular Protein 
      Transfer.
LID - 10.3390/proteomes11020015 [doi]
LID - 15
AB  - Cellular interactions within the bone marrow microenvironment modulate the 
      properties of subsets of leukemic cells leading to the development of 
      drug-resistant phenotypes. The intercellular transfer of proteins and organelles 
      contributes to this process but the set of transferred proteins and their effects 
      in the receiving cells remain unclear. This study aimed to detect the 
      intercellular protein transfer from mouse bone marrow stromal cells (OP9 cell 
      line) to human T-lymphoblasts (CCRF-CEM cell line) using nanoLC-MS/MS-based 
      shotgun proteomics in a 3D co-culture system. After 24 h of co-culture, 1513 and 
      67 proteins from human and mouse origin, respectively, were identified in 
      CCRF-CEM cells. The presence of mouse proteins in the human cell line, detected 
      by analyzing the differences in amino acid sequences of orthologous peptides, was 
      interpreted as the result of intercellular transfer. The transferred proteins 
      might have contributed to the observed resistance to vincristine, methotrexate, 
      and hydrogen peroxide in the co-cultured leukemic cells. Our results suggest that 
      shotgun proteomic analyses of co-cultured cells from different species could be a 
      simple option to get a preliminary survey of the proteins exchanged among 
      interacting cells.

PG  - 375-379
LID - 10.1016/j.ibneur.2023.03.009 [doi]
AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a debilitating condition that impairs cognition and 
      episodic memory. AD is well known for its behavioural phenotype however, knowing 
      its cellular pathology, which is primarily based on the presence of amyloid beta 
      (Aβ) in various aggregation states, is crucial for the development of research 
      efforts against the disorder. The most notable of these aggregation states are 
      the oligomeric and fibril forms of Aβ. This paper aims to describe the 
      transcriptomic profile of neuronal cells exposed to these aggregation states in 
      order to better understand the disorder and identify potential therapeutic 
      genetic targets. The primary findings of this paper illustrate the significant 
      effects of Aβ on genes associated with metabolism as well as the dramatically 
      increased effects of oligomeric Aβ relative to fibril Aβ with respect to the 
      overall changes in gene expression. The presented results also support the 
      further examination of the role of GTPases in the deleterious effects of Aβ.

AB  - Functional explication of genes is of great scientific value. However, 
      conventional methods have challenges for those genes that may affect biological 
      processes but are not annotated in public databases. Here, we developed a novel 
      explainable gene ontology fingerprint (XGOF) method to automatically produce 
      knowledge networks on biomedical literature in a given field which quantitatively 
      characterizes the association between genes and ontologies. XGOF provides 
      systematic knowledge for the potential function of genes and ontologically 
      compares similarities and discrepancies in different disease-XGOFs integrating 
      omics data. More importantly, XGOF can not only help to infer major cellular 
      components in a disease microenvironment but also reveal novel gene panels or 
      functions for in-depth experimental research where few explicit connections to 
      diseases have previously been described in the literature. The reliability of 
      XGOF is validated in four application scenarios, indicating a unique perspective 
      of integrating text and data mining, with the potential to accelerate scientific 
      discovery.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cell free RNA (cfRNA) contains transcript fragments from multiple 
      cell types, making it useful for cancer detection in clinical settings. However, 
      the pathophysiological origins of cfRNAs in plasma from colorectal cancer (CRC) 
      patients remain unclear. METHODS: To identify the tissue-specific contributions 
      of cfRNAs transcriptomic profile, we used a published single-cell transcriptomics 
      profile to deconvolute cell type abundance among paired plasma samples from CRC 
      patients who underwent tumor-ablative surgery. We further validated the 
      differentially expressed cfRNAs in 5 pairs of CRC tumor samples and adjacent 
      tissue samples as well as 3 additional CRC tumor samples using RNA-sequencing. 
      RESULTS: The transcriptomic component from intestinal secretory cells was 
      significantly decreased in the in-house post-surgical cfRNA. The HPGD, PACS1, and 
      TDP2 expression was consistent across cfRNA and tissue samples. Using the Cancer 
      Genome Atlas (TCGA) CRC datasets, we were able to classify the patients into two 
      groups with significantly different survival outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      three-gene signature holds promise in applying minimal residual disease (MRD) 
      testing, which involves profiling remnants of cancer cells after or during 
      treatment. Biomarkers identified in the present study need to be validated in a 
      larger cohort of samples in order to ascertain their possible use in early 
      diagnosis of CRC.

TI  - Transcriptomic analysis of lung development in wildtype and CFTR(-/-) sheep

AB  - The precise molecular events initiating human lung disease are often poorly 
      characterized. Investigating prenatal events that may underlie lung disease in 
      later life is challenging in man, but insights from the well-characterized sheep 
      model of lung development are valuable. Here, we determine the transcriptomic 
      signature of lung development in wild-type sheep (WT) and use a sheep model of 
      cystic fibrosis (CF) to characterize disease associated changes in gene 
      expression through the pseudoglandular, canalicular, saccular, and alveolar 
      stages of lung growth and differentiation. Using gene ontology process enrichment 
      analysis of differentially expressed genes at each developmental time point, we 
      define changes in biological processes (BP) in proximal and distal lung from WT 
      or CF animals. We also compare divergent BP in WT and CF animals at each time 
      point. Next, we establish the developmental profile of key genes encoding 
      components of ion transport and innate immunity that are pivotal in CF lung 
      disease and validate transcriptomic data by RT-qPCR. Consistent with the known 
      pro-inflammatory phenotype of the CF lung after birth, we observe upregulation of 
      inflammatory response processes in the CF sheep distal lung during the saccular 
      stage of prenatal development. These data suggest early commencement of 
      therapeutic regimens may be beneficial.

TI  - Expression of retrotransposons contributes to aging in Drosophila.
LID - 10.1093/genetics/iyad073 [doi]
LID - iyad073
AB  - Retrotransposons are a class of transposable elements capable of self-replication 
      and insertion into new genomic locations. Across species, the mobilization of 
      retrotransposons in somatic cells has been suggested to contribute to the cell 
      and tissue functional decline that occurs during aging. Retrotransposons are 
      broadly expressed across cell types, and de novo insertions have been observed to 
      correlate with tumorigenesis. However, the extent to which new retrotransposon 
      insertions occur during normal aging and their effect on cellular and animal 
      function remains understudied. Here, we use a single nucleus whole genome 
      sequencing approach in Drosophila to directly test whether transposon insertions 
      increase with age in somatic cells. Analyses of nuclei from thoraces and indirect 
      flight muscles using a newly developed pipeline, Retrofind, revealed no 
      significant increase in the number of transposon insertions with age. Despite 
      this, reducing the expression of two different retrotransposons, 412 and Roo, 
      extended lifespan, but did not alter indicators of health such as stress 
      resistance. This suggests a key role for transposon expression and not insertion 
      in regulating longevity. Transcriptomic analyses revealed similar changes to gene 
      expression in 412 and Roo knockdown flies and highlighted changes to genes 
      involved in proteolysis and immune function as potential contributors to the 
      observed changes in longevity. Combined, our data show a clear link between 
      retrotransposon expression and aging.

TI  - Transcriptomic Profiling of circRNAs in rat Hippocampus after Deep Hypothermic 
      Circulatory Arrest.

AB  - Neurologic abnormalities occurring after deep hypothermic circulatory arrest 
      (DHCA) remain a significant concern. However, molecular mechanisms leading to 
      DHCA-related cerebral injury are still ill-defined. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are 
      a class of covalently closed non-coding RNAs and can play important roles in 
      different types of cerebral injury. This study aimed to investigate circRNAs 
      expression profiles in rat hippocampus after DHCA and explore the potential 
      functions of circRNAs in DHCA-related cerebral injury. Hence, the DHCA procedure 
      in rats was established and a transcriptomic profiling of circRNAs in rat 
      hippocampus was done. As a result, a total of 35192 circRNAs were identified. 
      Among them, 339 circRNAs were dysregulated, including 194 down-regulated and 145 
      up-regulated between DHCA and sham group. Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of 
      Genes and Genomes analyses were performed based on the host genes of all 
      dysregulated circRNAs. Also, 4 circRNAs were validated by RT-qPCR 
      (rno_circ_0028462, rno_circ_0037165, rno_circ_0045161 and rno_circ_0019047). Then 
      a circRNA-microRNA (miRNA) interaction network involving 4 candidate circRNAs was 
      constructed. Furthermore, functional enrichment analysis of the miRNA-targeting 
      mRNAs of every candidate circRNA was conducted to gain insight into each of the 4 
      circRNAs. Our study provided a better understanding of circRNAs in the mechanisms 
      of DHCA-related cerebral injury and some potential targets for neuroprotection.

AB  - Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is the most common chronic liver disease 
      globally and a leading cause for liver transplantation in the US. Its 
      pathogenesis remains imprecisely defined. We combined two high-resolution 
      modalities to tissue samples from NASH clinical trials, machine learning 
      (ML)-based quantification of histological features and transcriptomics, to 
      identify genes that are associated with disease progression and clinical events. 
      A histopathology-driven 5-gene expression signature predicted disease progression 
      and clinical events in patients with NASH with F3 (pre-cirrhotic) and F4 
      (cirrhotic) fibrosis. Notably, the Notch signaling pathway and genes implicated 
      in liver-related diseases were enriched in this expression signature. In a 
      validation cohort where pharmacologic intervention improved disease histology, 
      multiple Notch signaling components were suppressed.

AB  - There is increasing interest in the African spiny mouse ( Acomys cahirinus ) as a 
      model organism because of its ability for regeneration of tissue after injury in 
      skin, muscle, and internal organs such as the kidneys. A high-quality reference 
      genome is needed to better understand these regenerative properties at the 
      molecular level. Here, we present an improved reference genome for A. cahirinus 
      generated from long Nanopore sequencing reads. We confirm the quality of our 
      annotations using RNA sequencing data from four different tissues. Our genome is 
      of higher contiguity and quality than previously reported genomes from this 
      species and will facilitate ongoing efforts to better understand the regenerative 
      properties of this organism.

TI  - CD95/Fas ligand mRNA is toxic to cells through more than one mechanism.
PG  - 11
LID - 10.1186/s43556-023-00119-1 [doi]
LID - 11
AB  - CD95/Fas ligand (CD95L) induces apoptosis through protein binding to the CD95 
      receptor. However, CD95L mRNA also induces toxicity in the absence of CD95 
      through induction of DISE (Death Induced by Survival Gene Elimination), a form of 
      cell death mediated by RNA interference (RNAi). We now report that CD95L mRNA 
      processing generates a short (s)RNA nearly identical to shL3, a commercial 
      CD95L-targeting shRNA that led to the discovery of DISE. Neither of the miRNA 
      biogenesis proteins Drosha nor Dicer are required for this processing. 
      Interestingly, CD95L toxicity depends on the core component of the RISC, Ago2, in 
      some cell lines, but not in others. In the HCT116 colon cancer cell line, Ago 1-4 
      appear to function redundantly in RNAi. In fact, Ago 1/2/3 knockout cells retain 
      sensitivity to CD95L mRNA toxicity. Toxicity was only blocked by mutation of all 
      in-frame start codons in the CD95L ORF. Dying cells exhibited an enrichment of 
      RISC bound (R)-sRNAs with toxic 6mer seed sequences, while expression of the 
      non-toxic CD95L mutant enriched for loading of R-sRNAs with nontoxic 6mer seeds. 
      However, CD95L is not the only source of these R-sRNAs. We find that CD95L mRNA 
      may induce DISE directly and indirectly, and that alternate mechanisms may 
      underlie CD95L mRNA processing and toxicity.

TI  - Stalled oligodendrocyte differentiation in IDH-mutant gliomas.
PG  - 24
LID - 10.1186/s13073-023-01175-6 [doi]
LID - 24
AB  - BACKGROUND: Roughly 50% of adult gliomas harbor isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) 
      mutations. According to the 2021 WHO classification guideline, these gliomas are 
      diagnosed as astrocytomas, harboring no 1p19q co-deletion, or oligodendrogliomas, 
      harboring 1p19q co-deletion. Recent studies report that IDH-mutant gliomas share 
      a common developmental hierarchy. However, the neural lineages and 
      differentiation stages in IDH-mutant gliomas remain inadequately characterized. 
      METHODS: Using bulk transcriptomes and single-cell transcriptomes, we identified 
      genes enriched in IDH-mutant gliomas with or without 1p19q co-deletion, we also 
      assessed the expression pattern of stage-specific signatures and key regulators 
      of oligodendrocyte lineage differentiation. We compared the expression of 
      oligodendrocyte lineage stage-specific markers between quiescent and 
      proliferating malignant single cells. The gene expression profiles were validated 
      using RNAscope analysis and myelin staining and were further substantiated using 
      data of DNA methylation and single-cell ATAC-seq. As a control, we assessed the 
      expression pattern of astrocyte lineage markers. RESULTS: Genes concordantly 
      enriched in both subtypes of IDH-mutant gliomas are upregulated in 
      oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPC). Signatures of early stages of 
      oligodendrocyte lineage and key regulators of OPC specification and maintenance 
      are enriched in all IDH-mutant gliomas. In contrast, signature of myelin-forming 
      oligodendrocytes, myelination regulators, and myelin components are significantly 
      down-regulated or absent in IDH-mutant gliomas. Further, single-cell 
      transcriptomes of IDH-mutant gliomas are similar to OPC and 
      differentiation-committed oligodendrocyte progenitors, but not to myelinating 
      oligodendrocyte. Most IDH-mutant glioma cells are quiescent; quiescent cells and 
      proliferating cells resemble the same differentiation stage of oligodendrocyte 
      lineage. Mirroring the gene expression profiles along the oligodendrocyte 
      lineage, analyses of DNA methylation and single-cell ATAC-seq data demonstrate 
      that genes of myelination regulators and myelin components are hypermethylated 
      and show inaccessible chromatin status, whereas regulators of OPC specification 
      and maintenance are hypomethylated and show open chromatin status. Markers of 
      astrocyte precursors are not enriched in IDH-mutant gliomas. CONCLUSIONS: Our 
      studies show that despite differences in clinical manifestation and genomic 
      alterations, all IDH-mutant gliomas resemble early stages of oligodendrocyte 
      lineage and are stalled in oligodendrocyte differentiation due to blocked 
      myelination program. These findings provide a framework to accommodate biological 
      features and therapy development for IDH-mutant gliomas.

AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNA) load onto AGO proteins to target mRNAs for translational 
      repression or degradation. However, miRNA degradation can be triggered when 
      extensively base-paired with target RNAs, which induces confirmational change of 
      AGO and recruitment of ZSWIM8 ubiquitin ligase to mark AGO for proteasomal 
      degradation. This target RNA-directed miRNA degradation (TDMD) mechanism appears 
      to be evolutionarily conserved, but recent studies have focused on mammalian 
      systems. Here, we performed AGO1-CLASH in Drosophila S2 cells, with Dora 
      (ortholog of vertebrate ZSWIM8) knockout mediated by CRISPR-Cas9 to identify five 
      TDMD triggers (sequences that can induce miRNA degradation). Interestingly, one 
      trigger in the 3' UTR of AGO1 mRNA induces miR-999 degradation. CRISPR-Cas9 
      knockout of the AGO1 trigger in S2 cells and in Drosophila specifically elevates 
      miR-999, with concurrent repression of the miR-999 targets. AGO1 trigger knockout 
      flies respond poorly to hydrogen peroxide-induced stress, demonstrating the 
      physiological importance of this TDMD event.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Reprogramming of immunosuppressive tumor-associated macrophages 
      (TAMs) presents an attractive therapeutic strategy in cancer. The aim of this 
      study was to explore the role of macrophage CD5L protein in TAM activity and 
      assess its potential as a therapeutic target. METHODS: Monoclonal antibodies 
      (mAbs) against recombinant CD5L were raised by subcutaneous immunization of 
      BALB/c mice. Peripheral blood monocytes were isolated from healthy donors and 
      stimulated with IFN/LPS, IL4, IL10, and conditioned medium (CM) from different 
      cancer cell lines in the presence of anti-CD5L mAb or controls. Subsequently, 
      phenotypic markers, including CD5L, were quantified by flow cytometry, IF and 
      RT-qPCR. Macrophage CD5L protein expression was studied in 55 human papillary 
      lung adenocarcinoma (PAC) samples by IHC and IF. Anti-CD5L mAb and isotype 
      control were administered intraperitoneally into a syngeneic Lewis Lung Carcinoma 
      mouse model and tumor growth was measured. Tumor microenvironment (TME) changes 
      were determined by flow cytometry, IHC, IF, Luminex, RNAseq and RT-qPCR. 
      FINDINGS: Cancer cell lines CM induced an immunosuppressive phenotype (increase 
      in CD163, CD206, MERTK, VEGF and CD5L) in cultured macrophages. Accordingly, high 
      TAM expression of CD5L in PAC was associated with poor patient outcome (Log-rank 
      (Mantel-Cox) test p = 0.02). We raised a new anti-CD5L mAb that blocked the 
      immunosuppressive phenotype of macrophages in vitro. Its administration in vivo 
      inhibited tumor progression of lung cancer by altering the intratumoral myeloid 
      cell population profile and CD4(+) T-cell exhaustion phenotype, thereby 
      significantly modifying the TME and increasing the inflammatory milieu. 
      INTERPRETATION: CD5L protein plays a key function in modulating the activity of 
      macrophages and their interactions within the TME, which supports its role as a 
      therapeutic target in cancer immunotherapy. FUNDING: For a full list of funding

TI  - Mycobacterium leprae and host immune transcriptomic signatures for reactional 
      states in leprosy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mycobacterium leprae transcriptomic and human host immune gene 
      expression signatures that demonstrate a plausible association with type I (T1R) 
      and type II reactions (T2R) aid in early diagnosis, prevention of nerve damage 
      and consequent demyelinating neuropathy in leprosy. The aim of the study is to 
      identify M. leprae and host-associated gene-expression signatures that are 
      associated with reactional states in leprosy. METHODS: The differentially 
      expressed genes from the whole transcriptome of M. leprae were determined using 
      genome-wide hybridization arrays with RNA extracted from skin biopsies of 20 T1R, 
      20 T2R and 20 non reactional controls (NR). Additionally, human immune 
      gene-expressions were profiled using RT2-PCR profiler arrays and real-time qPCRs. 
      RESULTS: The RNA quality was optimal in 16 NR, 18 T1R and 19 T2R samples. Whole 
      transcriptome expression array of these samples revealed significant upregulation 
      of the genes that encode integral and intrinsic membrane proteins, hydrolases and 
      oxidoreductases. In T1R lesional skin biopsy specimens, the top 10 significantly 
      upregulated genes are ML2064, ML1271, ML1960, ML1220, ML2498, ML1996, ML2388, 
      ML0429, ML2030 and ML0224 in comparison to NR. In T2R, genes ML2498, ML1526, 
      ML0394, ML1960, ML2388, ML0429, ML0281, ML1847, ML1618 and ML1271 were 
      significantly upregulated. We noted ML2664 was significantly upregulated in T1R 
      and repressed in T2R. Conversely, we have not noted any genes upregulated in T2R 
      and repressed in T1R. In both T1R and T2R, ML2388 was significantly upregulated. 
      This gene encodes a probable membrane protein and epitope prediction using 
      Bepipred-2.0 revealed a distinct B-cell epitope. Overexpression of ML2388 was 
      noted consistently across the reaction samples. From the host immune gene 
      expression profiles, genes for CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL2, CD40LG, IL17A and CXCL11 
      were upregulated in T1R when compared to the NR. In T2R, CXCL10, CXCL11, CXCL9, 
      CXCL2 and CD40LG were upregulated when compared to the NR group. CONCLUSION: A 
      gene set signature involving bacterial genes ML2388, ML2664, and host immune 
      genes CXCL10 and IL-17A can be transcriptomic markers for reactional states in 
      leprosy.

TI  - Comparative Transcriptomic Analysis of Archival Human Vestibular Schwannoma 
      Tissue from Patients with and without Tinnitus.
LID - 10.3390/jcm12072642 [doi]
LID - 2642
AB  - Vestibular schwannoma (VS) is an intracranial tumor that commonly presents with 
      tinnitus and hearing loss. To uncover the molecular mechanisms underlying 
      VS-associated tinnitus, we applied next-generation sequencing (Illumina HiSeq) to 
      formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded archival VS samples from nine patients with 
      tinnitus (VS-Tin) and seven patients without tinnitus (VS-NoTin). Bioinformatic 
      analysis was used to detect differentially expressed genes (DEG; i.e., ≥two-fold 
      change [FC]) while correcting for multiple comparisons. Using RNA-seq analysis, 
      VS-Tin had significantly lower expression of GFAP (logFC = -3.04), APLNR (logFC = 
      -2.95), PREX2 (logFC = -1.44), and PLVAP (logFC = -1.04; all p < 0.01) vs. 
      VS-NoTin. These trends were validated by using real-time RT-qPCR. At the protein 
      level, immunohistochemistry revealed a trend for less PREX2 and apelin expression 
      and greater expression of NLRP3 inflammasome and CD68-positive macrophages in 
      VS-Tin than in VS-NoTin, suggesting the activation of inflammatory processes in 
      VS-Tin. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that the top three protein 
      categories-glycoproteins, signal peptides, and secreted proteins-were 
      significantly enriched in VS-Tin in comparison with VS-NoTin. In a gene set 
      enrichment analysis, the top pathway was allograft rejection, an inflammatory 
      pathway that includes the MMP9, CXCL9, IL16, PF4, ITK, and ACVR2A genes. Future 
      studies are needed to examine the importance of these candidates and of 
      inflammation in VS-associated tinnitus.

TI  - Insights on the Biomarker Potential of Exosomal Non-Coding RNAs in Colorectal 
      Cancer: An In Silico Characterization of Related Exosomal 
      lncRNA/circRNA-miRNA-Target Axis.
LID - 10.3390/cells12071081 [doi]
LID - 1081
AB  - Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common cancer types, ranking third 
      after lung and breast cancers. As such, it demands special attention for better 
      characterization, which may eventually result in the development of early 
      detection strategies and preventive measures. Currently, components of bodily 
      fluids, which may reflect various disease states, are being increasingly 
      researched for their biomarker potential. One of these components is the 
      circulating extracellular vesicles, namely, exosomes, which are demonstrated to 
      carry various cargo. Of importance, the non-coding RNA cargo of circulating 
      exosomes, especially long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), circular RNAs (circRNAs), 
      and micro RNAs (miRNAs), may potentially serve as significant diagnostic and 
      prognostic/predictive biomarkers. In this review, we present existing evidence on 
      the diagnostic and prognostic/predictive biomarker value of exosomal non-coding 
      RNAs in CRC. In addition, taking advantage of the miRNA sponging functionality of 
      lncRNAs and circRNAs, we demonstrate an experimentally validated CRC exosomal 
      non-coding RNA-regulated target gene axis benefiting from published miRNA 
      sponging studies in CRC. Hence, we present a set of target genes and pathways 
      downstream of the lncRNA/circRNA-miRNA-target axis along with associated 
      significant Gene Ontology (GO) terms and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes 
      (KEGG) pathways, which may collectively serve to better characterize CRC and shed 
      light on the significance of exosomal non-coding RNAs in CRC diagnosis and 
      prognosis/prediction.

      study in 207 term neonates in developing Human Connectome Project.
PG  - 121

AB  - Increasing lines of evidence suggest deviations from the normal early 
      developmental trajectory could give rise to the onset of schizophrenia during 
      adolescence and young adulthood, but few studies have investigated brain imaging 
      changes associated with schizophrenia common variants in neonates. This study 
      compared the brain volumes of both grey and white matter regions with 
      schizophrenia polygenic risk scores (PRS) for 207 healthy term-born infants of 
      European ancestry. Linear regression was used to estimate the relationship 
      between PRS and brain volumes, with gestational age at birth, postmenstrual age 
      at scan, ancestral principal components, sex and intracranial volumes as 
      covariates. The schizophrenia PRS were negatively associated with the grey 
      (β = -0.08, p = 4.2 × 10(-3)) and white (β = -0.13, p = 9.4 × 10(-3)) matter 
      superior temporal gyrus volumes, white frontal lobe volume (β = -0.09, 
      p = 1.5 × 10(-3)) and the total white matter volume (β = -0.062, 
      p = 1.66 × 10(-2)). This result also remained robust when incorporating 
      individuals of Asian ancestry. Explorative functional analysis of the 
      schizophrenia risk variants associated with the right frontal lobe white matter 
      volume found enrichment in neurodevelopmental pathways. This preliminary result 
      suggests possible involvement of schizophrenia risk genes in early brain growth, 
      and potential early life structural alterations long before the average age of 
      onset of the disease.

AB  - Glaucoma is the second leading cause of irreversible blindness, and primary 
      open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is the most common type. Due to inadequate diagnosis, 
      treatment is often not administered until symptoms occur. Hence, approaches 
      enabling earlier prediction or diagnosis of POAG are necessary. We aimed to 
      identify novel drugs for glaucoma through bioinformatics and network analysis. 
      Data from 36 samples, obtained from the trabecular meshwork of healthy 
      individuals and patients with POAG, were acquired from a dataset. Next, 
      differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified to construct a 
      protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. In both stages, the genes were 
      enriched by studying the critical biological processes and pathways related to 
      POAG. Finally, a drug-gene network was constructed, and novel drugs for POAG 
      treatment were proposed. Genes with p < 0.01 and |log fold change| > 0.3 (1,350 
      genes) were considered DEGs and utilized to construct a PPI network. Enrichment 
      analysis yielded several key pathways that were upregulated or downregulated. For 
      example, extracellular matrix organization, the immune system, neutrophil 
      degranulation, and cytokine signaling were upregulated among immune pathways, 
      while signal transduction, the immune system, extracellular matrix organization, 
      and receptor tyrosine kinase signaling were downregulated. Finally, novel drugs 
      including metformin hydrochloride, ixazomib citrate, and cisplatin warrant 
      further analysis of their potential roles in POAG treatment. The candidate drugs 
      identified in this computational analysis require in vitro and in vivo validation 
      to confirm their effectiveness in POAG treatment. This may pave the way for 
      understanding life-threatening disorders such as cancer.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an inflammatory and infectious disease 
      caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 virus with a complex 
      pathophysiology. While COVID-19 vaccines and boosters are available, treatment of 
      the disease is primarily supportive and symptomatic. Several research have 
      suggested the potential of herbal medicines as an adjunctive treatment for the 
      disease. A popular herbal medicine approved in the Philippines for the treatment 
      of acute respiratory disease is Vitex negundo L. In fact, the Department of 
      Science and Technology of the Philippines has funded a clinical trial to 
      establish its potential as an adjunctive treatment for COVID-19. Here, we 
      utilized network pharmacology and molecular docking in determining pivotal 
      targets of Vitex negundo compounds against COVID-19. The results showed that 
      significant targets of Vitex negundo compounds in COVID-19 are CSB, SERPINE1, and 
      PLG which code for cathepsin B, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and 
      plasminogen, respectively. Molecular docking revealed that α-terpinyl acetate and 
      geranyl acetate have good binding affinity in cathepsin B; 
      6,7,4-trimethoxyflavanone, 5,6,7,8,3',4',5'-heptamethoxyflavone, artemetin, 
      demethylnobiletin, gardenin A, geranyl acetate in plasminogen; and 
      7,8,4-trimethoxyflavanone in plasminogen activator inhibitor-1. While the results 
      are promising, these are bound to the limitations of computational methods and 
      further experimentation are needed to completely establish the molecular 
      mechanisms of Vitex negundo against COVID-19.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Depression is a common psychiatric illness and global public health 
      problem. However, our limited understanding of the biological basis of depression 
      has hindered the development of novel treatments and interventions. METHODS: To 
      identify new candidate genes for therapeutic development, we examined 
      single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snucRNAseq) data from the dorsolateral prefrontal 
      cortex (N=424) in relation to ante-mortem depressive symptoms. To complement 
      these direct analyses, we also used genome- wide association study (GWAS) results 
      for depression (N=500,199) along with genetic tools for inferring the expression 
      of 22,159 genes in 7 cell types and 55 cell subtypes to perform 
      transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) of depression followed by Mendelian 
      randomization (MR). RESULTS: Our single-nucleus TWAS analysis identified 71 
      causal genes in depression that have a role in specific neocortical cell 
      subtypes; 59 of 71 genes were novel compared to previous studies. Depression TWAS 
      genes showed a cell type specific pattern, with the greatest enrichment being in 
      both excitatory and inhibitory neurons as well as astrocytes. Gene expression in 
      different neuron subtypes have different directions of effect on depression risk. 
      Compared to lower genetically correlated traits (e.g. body mass index) with 
      depression, higher correlated traits (e.g., neuroticism) have more common TWAS 
      genes with depression. In parallel, we performed differential gene expression 
      analysis in relation to depression in 55 cortical cell subtypes, and we found 
      that genes such as ANKRD36 , MADD , TAOK3 , SCAI and CHUK are associated with 
      depression in specific cell subtypes. CONCLUSIONS: These two sets of analyses 
      illustrate the utility of large snucRNAseq data to uncover both genes whose 
      expression is altered in specific cell subtypes in the context of depression and 
      to enhance the interpretation of well-powered GWAS so that we can prioritize 
      specific susceptibility genes for further analysis and therapeutic development.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Antiretroviral treatment regimens can effectively control HIV 
      replication and some aspects of disease progression. However, molecular events in 
      end-organ diseases such as central nervous system (CNS) disease are not yet fully 
      understood, and routine eradication of latent reservoirs is not yet in reach. 
      Brain tissue-derived extracellular vesicles (bdEVs) act locally in the source 
      tissue and may indicate molecular mechanisms in HIV CNS pathology. Regulatory 
      RNAs from EVs have emerged as important participants in HIV disease pathogenesis. 
      Using brain tissue and bdEVs from the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) model 
      of HIV disease, we profiled messenger RNAs (mRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs), and 
      circular RNAs (circRNAs), seeking to identify possible networks of RNA 
      interaction in SIV infection and neuroinflammation. METHODS: Postmortem occipital 
      cortex tissue were collected from pigtailed macaques: uninfected controls and 
      SIV-infected subjects (acute phase and chronic phase with or without CNS 
      pathology). bdEVs were separated and characterized in accordance with 
      international consensus standards. RNAs from bdEVs and source tissue were used 
      for sequencing and qPCR to detect mRNA, miRNA, and circRNA levels. RESULTS: 
      Multiple dysregulated bdEV RNAs, including mRNAs, miRNAs, and circRNAs, were 
      identified in acute infection and chronic infection with pathology. Most 
      dysregulated mRNAs in bdEVs reflected dysregulation in their source tissues. 
      These mRNAs are disproportionately involved in inflammation and immune responses, 
      especially interferon pathways. For miRNAs, qPCR assays confirmed differential 
      abundance of miR-19a-3p, let-7a-5p, and miR-29a-3p (acute SIV infection), and 
      miR-146a-5p and miR-449a-5p (chronic with pathology) in bdEVs. In addition, 
      target prediction suggested that several circRNAs that were differentially 
      abundant in source tissue might be responsible for specific differences in small 
      RNA levels in bdEVs during SIV infection. CONCLUSIONS: RNA profiling of bdEVs and 
      source tissues reveals potential regulatory networks in SIV infection and 
      SIV-related CNS pathology.

AB  - Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) is a congenital heart disease where the 
      left ventricle is reduced in size. A forward genetic screen in mice identified 
      SIN3A associated protein 130kDa ( Sap130 ), a protein in the chromatin modifying 
      SIN3A/HDAC1 complex, as a gene contributing to the digenic etiology of HLHS. 
      Here, we report the role of zebrafish sap130 genes in heart development. Loss of 
      sap130a, one of two Sap130 orthologs, resulted in smaller ventricle size, a 
      phenotype reminiscent to the hypoplastic left ventricle in mice. While cardiac 
      progenitors were normal during somitogenesis, diminution of the ventricle size 
      suggest the Second Heart Field (SHF) was the source of the defect. To explore the 
      role of sap130a in gene regulation, transcriptome profiling was performed after 
      the heart tube formation to identify candidate pathways and genes responsible for 
      the small ventricle phenotype. Genes involved in cardiac differentiation and cell 
      communication were dysregulated in sap130a , but not in sap130b mutants. Confocal 
      light sheet analysis measured deficits in cardiac output in MZsap130a supporting 
      the notion that cardiomyocyte maturation was disrupted. Lineage tracing 
      experiments revealed a significant reduction of SHF cells in the ventricle that 
      resulted in increased outflow tract size. These data suggest that sap130a is 
      involved in cardiogenesis via regulating the accretion of SHF cells to the 
      growing ventricle and in their subsequent maturation for cardiac function. 
      Further, genetic studies revealed an interaction between hdac1 and sap130a , in 
      the incidence of small ventricles. These studies highlight the conserved role of 
      Sap130a and Hdac1 in zebrafish cardiogenesis.

TI  - Human basal-like breast cancer is represented by one of the two mammary tumor 
      subtypes in dogs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: About 20% of breast cancers in humans are basal-like, a subtype that 
      is often triple negative and difficult to treat. An effective translational model 
      for basal-like breast cancer (BLBC) is currently lacking and urgently needed. To 
      determine if spontaneous mammary tumors in pet dogs could meet this need, we 
      subtyped canine mammary tumors and evaluated the dog-human molecular homology at 
      the subtype level. METHODS: We subtyped 236 canine mammary tumors from 3 studies 
      by applying various subtyping strategies on their RNA-seq data. We then performed 
      PAM50 classification with canine tumors alone, as well as with canine tumors 
      combined with human breast tumors. We investigated differential gene expression, 
      signature gene set enrichment, expression association, mutational landscape, and 
      other features for dog-human subtype comparison. RESULTS: Our independent 
      genome-wide subtyping consistently identified two molecularly distinct subtypes 
      among the canine tumors. One subtype is mostly basal-like and clusters with human 
      BLBC in cross-species PAM50 classification, while the other subtype does not 
      cluster with any human breast cancer subtype. Furthermore, the canine basal-like 
      subtype recaptures key molecular features (e.g., cell cycle gene upregulation, 
      TP53 mutation) and gene expression patterns that characterize human BLBC. It is 
      enriched histological subtypes that match human breast cancer, unlike the other 
      canine subtype. However, about 33% of canine basal-like tumors are estrogen 
      receptor negative (ER-) and progesterone receptor positive (PR+), which is rare 
      in human breast cancer. Further analysis reveals that these ER-PR+ canine tumors 
      harbor additional basal-like features, including upregulation of genes of 
      interferon-γ response and of the Wnt-pluripotency pathway. Interestingly, we 
      observed an association of PGR expression with gene silencing in all canine 
      tumors, and with the expression of T cell exhaustion markers (e.g., PDCD1 ) in 
      ER-PR+ canine tumors. CONCLUSIONS: We identify a canine mammary tumor subtype 
      that molecularly resembles human BLBC overall, and thus could serve as a vital 
      spontaneous animal model of this devastating breast cancer subtype. Our study 
      also sheds light on the dog-human difference in the mammary tumor histology and 
      the hormonal cycle.

AB  - Introduction: Several recent studies pointed out that 
      chromodomain-helicase-DNA-binding protein 1-like (CHD1L) is a putative oncogene 
      in many human tumors. However, up to date, there is no pan-cancer analysis 
      performed to study the different aspects of this gene expression and behavior in 
      tumor tissues. Methods: Here, we applied several bioinformatics tools to make a 
      comprehensive analysis for CHD1L. Firstly we assessed the expression of CHD1L in 
      several types of human tumors and tried to correlate that with the stage and 
      grade of the analyzed tumors. Following that, we performed a survival analysis to 
      study the correlation between CHD1L upregulation in tumors and the clinical 
      outcome. Additionally, we investigated the mutation forms, the correlation with 
      several immune cell infiltration, and the potential molecular mechanisms of CHD1L 
      in the tumor tissue. Result and discussion: The results demonstrated that CHD1L 
      is a highly expressed gene across several types of tumors and that was correlated 
      with a poor prognosis for most cancer patients. Moreover, it was found that CHD1L 
      affects the tumor immune microenvironment by influencing the infiltration level 
      of several immune cells. Collectively, the current study provides a comprehensive 
      overview of the oncogenic roles of CHD1L where our results nominate CHD1L as a 
      potential prognostic biomarker and target for antitumor therapy development.

AB  - Recovery from opioid use disorder (OUD) and maintenance of abstinence from opioid 
      use is hampered by perseverant drug cravings that may persist for months after 
      cessation of drug use. Drug cravings can intensify during the abstinence period, 
      a phenomenon referred to as the 'incubation of craving' that has been 
      well-described in preclinical studies. We previously reported that animals that 
      self-administered heroin at a dosage of 0.075 mg/kg/infusion (HH) paired with 
      discrete drug cues displayed robust incubation of heroin craving behavior after 
      21 days (D) of forced abstinence, an effect that was not observed with a lower 
      dosage (0.03 mg/kg/infusion; HL). Here, we sought to elucidate molecular 
      mechanisms underlying long-term heroin seeking behavior by profiling microRNA 
      (miRNA) pathways in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), a brain region that modulates 
      incubation of heroin seeking. miRNAs are small noncoding RNAs with long 
      half-lives that have emerged as critical regulators of drug seeking behavior but 
      their expression in the OFC has not been examined in any drug exposure paradigm. 
      We employed next generation sequencing to detect OFC miRNAs differentially 
      expressed after 21D of forced abstinence between HH and HL animals, and 
      proteomics analysis to elucidate miRNA-dependent translational neuroadaptations. 
      We identified 55 OFC miRNAs associated with incubation of heroin craving, 
      including miR-485-5p, which was significantly downregulated following 21D forced 
      abstinence in HH but not HL animals. We bidirectionally manipulated miR-485-5p in 
      the OFC to demonstrate that miR-485-5p can regulate long-lasting heroin seeking 
      behavior after extended forced abstinence. Proteomics analysis identified 45 
      proteins selectively regulated in the OFC of HH but not HL animals that underwent 
      21D forced abstinence, of which 7 were putative miR-485-5p target genes. Thus, 
      the miR-485-5p pathway is dysregulated in animals with a phenotype of persistent 
      heroin craving behavior and OFC miR-485-5p pathways may function to support 
      long-lasting heroin seeking.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) is the negative 
      feedback regulator of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. The purpose of our study 
      was to investigate the SOCS3 status in colon primary tumor and lung metastasis 
      and its relationship with macrophages. METHODS: The SOCS3 expression pattern and 
      its relationship with the immune response in pan-cancer was investigated using 
      multiple methods. Samples and corresponding clinical information of 32 colon 
      cancer patients with lung metastasis were collected, and the CD68, CD163, and 
      SOCS3 status were conducted using immunohistochemistry (IHC). The relationship 
      between SOCS3 status and macrophage markers was analyzed. Besides, we explored 
      the molecular mechanisms of SOCS3 in lung metastasis via the TCGA database. 
      RESULTS: High SOCS3 expression was more inclined to poor prognosis and was 
      positively correlated with main immune cell infiltration in almost each cancer 
      type, especially in colon cancer. Compared with the colon primary tumor, lung 
      metastasis harbored higher CD163 and SOCS3 expression, and high SOCS3 expression 
      was more likely to be associated with high CD163 expression in lung metastasis. 
      Besides, the exceptional differentially expressed genes in lung metastasis 
      significantly enriched in immune responses and regulations. CONCLUSIONS: SOCS3 
      possessed value as a prognostic marker and target for immunotherapeutic 
      intervention in different tumors and might be a potential target of tumor 
      progression and tumor immunotherapy in colon cancer.

LID - 68
AB  - BACKGROUND: Oocyte maturation arrest and early embryonic arrest are important 
      reproductive phenotypes resulting in female infertility and cause the recurrent 
      failure of assisted reproductive technology (ART). However, the genetic 
      etiologies of these female infertility-related phenotypes are poorly understood. 
      Previous studies have mainly focused on inherited mutations based on large 
      pedigrees or consanguineous patients. However, the role of de novo mutations 
      (DNMs) in these phenotypes remains to be elucidated. RESULTS: To decipher the 
      role of DNMs in ART failure and female infertility with oocyte and embryo 
      defects, we explore the landscape of DNMs in 473 infertile parent-child trios and 
      identify a set of 481 confident DNMs distributed in 474 genes. Gene ontology 
      analysis reveals that the identified genes with DNMs are enriched in signaling 
      pathways associated with female reproductive processes such as meiosis, embryonic 
      development, and reproductive structure development. We perform functional assays 
      on the effects of DNMs in a representative gene Tubulin Alpha 4a (TUBA4A), which 
      shows the most significant enrichment of DNMs in the infertile parent-child 
      trios. DNMs in TUBA4A disrupt the normal assembly of the microtubule network in 
      HeLa cells, and microinjection of DNM TUBA4A cRNAs causes abnormalities in mouse 
      oocyte maturation or embryo development, suggesting the pathogenic role of these 
      DNMs in TUBA4A. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest novel genetic insights that 
      DNMs contribute to female infertility with oocyte and embryo defects. This study 
      also provides potential genetic markers and facilitates the genetic diagnosis of 
      recurrent ART failure and female infertility.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Ovarian cancer is one of the most lethal cancers in women because it 
      is often diagnosed at an advanced stage. The molecular markers investigated thus 
      far have been unsatisfactory. METHODS: We performed whole-exome sequencing on the 
      human ovarian cancer cell lines 3AO and ES2 and the normal ovarian epithelial 
      cell line IOSE-80. Molecular markers of ovarian cancer were screened from shared 
      mutation genes and copy number variation genes in the 6q21-qter region. RESULTS: 
      We found that missense mutations were the most common mutations in the gene 
      (93%). The MUC12, FLG and MUC16 genes were highly mutated in 3AO and ES2 cells. 
      Copy number amplification occurred mainly in 4p16.1 and 11q14.3, and copy number 
      deletions occurred in 4q34.3 and 18p11.21. A total of 23 hub genes were screened, 
      of which 16 were closely related to the survival of ovarian cancer patients. The 
      three genes CCDC170, THBS2 and COL14A1 are most significantly correlated with the 
      survival and prognosis of ovarian cancer. In particular, the overall survival of 
      ovarian cancer patients with high CCDC170 gene expression was significantly 
      prolonged (P < 0.001). The expression of CCDC170 in normal tissues was 
      significantly higher than that in ovarian cancer tissues (P < 0.05), and its 
      expression was significantly decreased in advanced ovarian cancer. Western 
      blotting and immunofluorescence assays also showed that the expression of CCDC170 
      in ovarian cancer cells was significantly lower than that in normal cells 
      (P < 0.001, P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: CCDC170 is expected to become a new 
      diagnostic molecular target and prognostic indicator for ovarian cancer patients, 
      which can provide new ideas for the design of antitumor drugs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the major causes of cancer-related 
      death worldwide. Although commercial biomarkers of CRC are currently available, 
      they are still lacking in terms of sensitivity and specificity; thus, searching 
      for reliable blood-based biomarkers are important for the primary screening of 
      CRC. METHODS: Plasma samples of patients with non-metastatic (NM) and metastatic 
      (M) CRC and healthy controls were fractionated using MARS-14 immunoaffinity 
      chromatography. The flow-through and elute fractions representing low- and 
      high-abundant proteins, respectively, were analyzed by label-free quantitative 
      proteomics mass spectrometry. The functional analysis of the proteins with 
      greater than 1.5-fold differential expression level between the CRC and the 
      healthy control groups were analyzed for their biological processes and molecular 
      functions. In addition, the levels of plasma proteins showing large alterations 
      in CRC patients were confirmed by immunoblotting using two independent cohorts. 
      Moreover, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed 
      for individual and combinations of biomarker candidates so as to evaluate the 
      diagnostic performance of biomarker candidates. RESULTS: From 163 refined 
      identifications, five proteins were up-regulated and two proteins were 
      down-regulated in NM-CRC while eight proteins were up-regulated and three 
      proteins were down-regulated in M-CRC, respectively. Altered plasma proteins in 
      NM-CRC were mainly involved in complement activation, while those in M-CRC were 
      clustered in acute-phase response, complement activation, and inflammatory 
      response. Results from the study- and validation-cohorts indicate that the levels 
      of leucine-rich alpha-2-glycoprotein-1(LRG), complement component C9 (C9), 
      alpha-1-acid glycoprotein 1 (AGP1), and alpha-1-antitrypsin (A1AT) were 
      statistically increased, while fibronectin (FN) level was statistically decreased 
      in CRC patients compared to healthy controls, with most alterations found in a 
      metastatic stage-dependent manner. ROC analysis revealed that FN exhibited the 
      best diagnostic performance to discriminate CRC patients and healthy controls 
      while AGP1 showed the best discrimination between the disease stages in both 
      cohorts. The combined biomarker candidates, FN + A1AT + AGP1, exhibited perfect 
      discriminatory power to discriminate between the CRC population and healthy 
      controls whereas LRG + A1AT + AGP1 was likely to be the best panel to 
      discriminate the metastatic stages in both cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: This study 
      identified and quantified distinct plasma proteome profiles of CRC patients. 
      Selected CRC biomarker candidates including FN, LRG, C9, A1AT, and AGP1 may be 
      further applied for screening larger cohorts including disease groups from other 
      types of cancer or other diseases.

AB  - Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is an epidemic animal 
      infectious disease worldwide. In our previous research it was suggested that 
      matrine could inhibit PRRSV infection both in vitro and in vivo, but the 
      antiviral mechanisms are still undecided. Network pharmacology can well solve the 
      difficult problem of "multiple targets, multiple pathways" in the research of TCM 
      action targets. The results of network pharmacology indicated that matrine exerts 
      its anti-PRRSV effect by targeting HSPA8 and HSP90AB1. The results of real-time 
      fluorescent quantitative PCR and western blot showed that infection with PRRSV 
      induced a significant increase in the expression of HSPA8 and HSP90AB1 whereas 
      matrine treatment could significantly reverse it, and the number of viruses of 
      PRRSV also decreased. In this study, the method of network pharmacology was used 
      to explore HSPA8 and HSP90AB1 which were the potential targets of matrine against 
      PRRSV on Marc-145 cells.

AB  - Skin plays central roles in systemic physiology, and it undergoes significant 
      functional changes during aging. Members of the peroxisome proliferator-activated 
      receptor-gamma coactivator (PGC-1) family (PGC-1s) are key regulators of the 
      biology of numerous tissues, yet we know very little about their impact on skin 
      functions. Global gene expression profiling and gene silencing in keratinocytes 
      uncovered that PGC-1s control the expression of metabolic genes as well as that 
      of terminal differentiation programs. Glutamine emerged as a key substrate 
      promoting mitochondrial respiration, keratinocyte proliferation, and the 
      expression of PGC-1s and terminal differentiation programs. Importantly, gene 
      silencing of PGC-1s reduced the thickness of a reconstructed living human 
      epidermal equivalent. Exposure of keratinocytes to a salicylic acid derivative 
      potentiated the expression of PGC-1s and terminal differentiation genes and 
      increased mitochondrial respiration. Overall, our results show that the PGC-1s 
      are essential effectors of epidermal physiology, revealing an axis that could be 
      targeted in skin conditions and aging.

TI  - Characterization of complement C3 as a marker of alpha-amanitin toxicity by 
      comparative secretome profiling.

AB  - In the human body, proteins secreted into peripheral blood vessels are known as 
      the secretome, and they represent the physiological or pathological status of 
      cells. The unique response of cells to toxin exposure can be confirmed via 
      secretome analysis, which can be used to discover toxic mechanisms or exposure 
      markers. Alpha-amanitin (α-AMA) is the most widely studied amatoxin and inhibits 
      transcription and protein synthesis by directly interacting with RNA polymerase 
      II. However, secretory proteins released during hepatic failure caused by α-AMA 
      have not been fully characterized. In this study, we analyzed the secretome of 
      α-AMA-treated Huh-7 cells and mice using a comparative proteomics technique. 
      Overall, 1440 and 208 proteins were quantified in cell media and mouse serum, 
      respectively. Based on the bioinformatics results for the commonly downregulated 
      proteins in cell media and mouse serum, we identified complement component 3 (C3) 
      as a marker for α-AMA-induced hepatotoxicity. Through western blot in cell 
      secretome and C3 ELISA assays in mouse serum, we validated α-AMA-induced 
      downregulation of C3. In conclusion, using comparative proteomics and molecular 
      biology techniques, we found that α-AMA-induced hepatotoxicity reduced C3 levels 
      in the secretome. We expect that this study will aid in identifying new toxic 
      mechanisms, therapeutic targets, and exposure markers of α-AMA-induced 
      hepatotoxicity. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The online version contains

AB  - Synapses are integral for healthy brain function and are becoming increasingly 
      recognized as key structures in the early stages of brain disease. Understanding 
      the pathological processes driving synaptic dysfunction will unlock new 
      therapeutic opportunities for some of the most devastating diseases of our time. 
      To achieve this we need a solid repertoire of imaging and molecular tools to 
      interrogate synaptic biology at greater resolution. Synapses have historically 
      been examined in small numbers, using highly technical imaging modalities, or in 
      bulk, using crude molecular approaches. However, recent advances in imaging 
      techniques are allowing us to analyze large numbers of synapses, at 
      single-synapse resolution. Furthermore, multiplexing is now achievable with some 
      of these approaches, meaning we can examine multiple proteins at individual 
      synapses in intact tissue. New molecular techniques now allow accurate 
      quantification of proteins from isolated synapses. The development of 
      increasingly sensitive mass-spectrometry equipment means we can now scan the 
      synaptic molecular landscape almost in totality and see how this changes in 
      disease. As we embrace these new technical developments, synapses will be viewed 
      with clearer focus, and the field of synaptopathy will become richer with 
      insightful and high-quality data. Here, we will discuss some of the ways in which 
      synaptic interrogation is being facilitated by methodological advances, focusing 
      on imaging, and mass spectrometry.

AB  - Advanced genomic and molecular profiling technologies accelerated the 
      enlightenment of the regulatory mechanisms behind cancer development and 
      progression, and the targeted therapies in patients. Along this line, intense 
      studies with immense amounts of biological information have boosted the discovery 
      of molecular biomarkers. Cancer is one of the leading causes of death around the 
      world in recent years. Elucidation of genomic and epigenetic factors in Breast 
      Cancer (BRCA) can provide a roadmap to uncover the disease mechanisms. 
      Accordingly, unraveling the possible systematic connections between-omics data 
      types and their contribution to BRCA tumor progression is crucial. In this study, 
      we have developed a novel machine learning (ML) based integrative approach for 
      multi-omics data analysis. This integrative approach combines information from 
      gene expression (mRNA), microRNA (miRNA) and methylation data. Due to the 
      complexity of cancer, this integrated data is expected to improve the prediction, 
      diagnosis and treatment of disease through patterns only available from the 3-way 
      interactions between these 3-omics datasets. In addition, the proposed method 
      bridges the interpretation gap between the disease mechanisms that drive onset 
      and progression. Our fundamental contribution is the 3 Multi-omics integrative 
      tool (3Mint). This tool aims to perform grouping and scoring of groups using 
      biological knowledge. Another major goal is improved gene selection via detection 
      of novel groups of cross-omics biomarkers. Performance of 3Mint is assessed using 
      different metrics. Our computational performance evaluations showed that the 
      3Mint classifies the BRCA molecular subtypes with lower number of genes when 
      compared to the miRcorrNet tool which uses miRNA and mRNA gene expression 
      profiles in terms of similar performance metrics (95% Accuracy). The 
      incorporation of methylation data in 3Mint yields a much more focused analysis. 
      The 3Mint tool and all other supplementary files are available at

AB  - BACKGROUND: Atherosclerosis is an underlying cause of cardiovascular disease 
      which is a leading cause of death worldwide. Foam cells play a crucial role in 
      atherosclerotic lesion development, and macrophages and vascular smooth muscle 
      cells (VSMCs) appear to contribute to the formation of the majority of 
      atheromatous foam cells via oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) uptake. 
      METHODS: An integrated, microarray-based analysis using GSE54666 and GSE68021, 
      which contain samples of human macrophages and VSMCs incubated with ox-LDL, was 
      conducted. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in each dataset were 
      investigated via the linear models for microarray data (limma) v. 3.40.6 software 
      package in R v. 4.1.2 (The R Foundation for Statistical Computing). Gene ontology 
      (GO) and pathway enrichment were performed via the ClueGO v. 2.5.8 and CluePedia 
      v. 1.5.8 databases and the Database of Annotation, Visualization and Integrated 
      (DAVID; https://david.ncifcrf.gov). The convergent DEGs in the two cell types 
      were obtained, and the protein interactions and network of transcriptional 
      factors were analyzed using the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting 
      Genes (STRING) v. 11.5 and the Transcriptional Regulatory Relationships Unraveled 
      by Sentence-based Text-mining (TRRUST) v. 2 databases. The selected DEGs were 
      further validated using external data from GSE9874, and a machine learning 
      algorithm of the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) 
      regression and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis were applied to 
      explore the candidate biomarkers. RESULTS: We discovered the significant DEGs and 
      pathways that were shared or unique among the 2 cell types, coupling with 
      enriched lipid metabolism in macrophages, and upregulated defense response in 
      VSMCs. Moreover, we identified BTG2, ABCA1, and SLC7A11 as potential biomarkers 
      and molecular targets for atherogenesis. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides a 
      comprehensive summary of the landscape of the transcriptional regulations in 
      macrophages and VSMCs under ox-LDL treatment from a bioinformatics perspective, 
      which may contribute to a better understanding of the pathophysiological 
      mechanisms of foam cell formation.

AB  - Interactions between tumor cells and the tumor microenvironment are critical for 
      tumor growth, progression, and response to therapy. Effective targeting of 
      oncogenic signaling pathways in tumors requires an understanding of how these 
      therapies impact both tumor cells and cells within the tumor microenvironment. 
      One such pathway is the janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator or 
      transcription (STAT) pathway, which is activated in both breast cancer cells and 
      in tumor associated macrophages. This study demonstrates that exposure of 
      macrophages to JAK inhibitors leads to activation of NF-κB signaling, which 
      results in increased expression of genes known to be associated with therapeutic 
      resistance. Furthermore, inhibition of the NF-κB pathway improves the ability of 
      ruxolitinib to reduce mammary tumor growth in vivo. Thus, the impact of the tumor 
      microenvironment is an important consideration in studying breast cancer and 
      understanding such mechanisms of resistance is critical to development of 
      effective targeted therapies.

LID - 10.1007/s10522-023-10027-0 [doi]
AB  - Aging is a topic of paramount importance in an increasingly elderly society and 
      has been the focus of extensive research. Protein homeostasis (proteostasis) 
      decline is a hallmark in aging and several age-related diseases, but which 
      specific proteins and mechanisms are involved in proteostasis (de)regulation 
      during the aging process remain largely unknown. Here, we used different 
      text-mining tools complemented with protein-protein interaction data to address 
      this complex topic. Analysis of the integrated protein interaction networks 
      identified novel proteins and pathways associated to proteostasis mechanisms and 
      aging or age-related disorders, indicating that this approach is useful to 
      identify previously unknown links and for retrieving information of potential 
      novel biomarkers or therapeutic targets.

TI  - Intratumor microbiota as a novel potential prognostic indicator in mesothelioma.
PG  - 1129513

LID - 1129513
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Despite increased attention on immunotherapy, primarily immune 
      checkpoint blockade, as a therapeutic approach for mesothelioma (MMe), its 
      efficacy and tolerability remain questioned. One potential explanation for 
      different responses to immunotherapy is the gut and intratumor microbiota; 
      however, these remain an underexplored facet of MMe. This article highlights the 
      cancer intratumor microbiota as a novel potential prognostic indicator in MMe. 
      METHODS: TCGA data on 86 MMe patients from cBioPortal underwent bespoke analysis. 
      Median overall survival was used to divide patients into "Low Survivors" and 
      "High Survivors". Comparison of these groups generated Kaplan-Meier survival 
      analysis, differentially expressed genes (DEGs), and identification of 
      differentially abundant microbiome signatures. Decontamination analysis refined 
      the list of signatures, which were validated as an independent prognostic 
      indicator through multiple linear regression modelling and Cox proportional 
      hazards modelling. Finally, functional annotation analysis on the list of DEGs 
      was performed to link the data together. RESULTS: 107 genera signatures were 
      significantly associated with patient survival (positively or negatively), whilst 
      clinical characteristic comparison between the two groups demonstrated that 
      epithelioid histology was more common in "High Survivors" versus biphasic in "Low 
      Survivors". Of the 107 genera, 27 had published articles related to cancer, 
      whilst only one (Klebsiella) had MMe-related published articles. Functional 
      annotation analysis of the DEGs between the two groups highlighted fatty acid 
      metabolism as the most enriched term in "High Survivors", whilst for "Low 
      Survivors" the enriched terms primarily related to cell cycle/division. Linking 
      these ideas and findings together is that the microbiome influences, and is 
      influenced by, lipid metabolism. Finally, to validate the independent prognostic 
      value of the microbiome, multiple linear regression modelling as well as Cox 
      proportional hazards modelling were employed, with both approaches demonstrating 
      that the microbiome was a better prognostic indicator than patient age or stage 
      of the cancer. DISCUSSION: The findings presented herein, alongside the very 
      limited literature from scoping searches to validate the genera, highlight the 
      microbiome and microbiota as a potentially rich source of fundamental analysis 
      and prognostic value. Further in vitro studies are needed to elucidate the 
      molecular mechanisms and functional links that may lead to altered survival.

AB  - Breast milk is an essential source of nutrition and hydration for the infant. In 
      addition, this highly complex biological fluid contains numerous immunologically 
      active factors such as microorganisms, immunoglobulins, cytokines and microRNAs 
      (miRNAs). Here, we set out to predict the function of the top 10 expressed miRNAs 
      in human breast milk, focusing on their relevance in oral tolerance development 
      and allergy prevention in the infant. The top expressed miRNAs in human breast 
      milk were identified on basis of previous peer-reviewed studies gathered from a 
      recent systematic review and an updated literature search. The miRNAs with the 
      highest expression levels in each study were used to identify the 10 most common 
      miRNAs or miRNA families across studies and these were selected for subsequent 
      target prediction. The predictions were performed using TargetScan in combination 
      with the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery. The ten 
      top expressed miRNAs were: let-7-5p family, miR-148a-3p, miR-30-5p family, 
      miR-200a-3p + miR-141-3p, miR-22-3p, miR-181-5p family, miR-146b-5p, miR-378a-3p, 
      miR-29-3p family, miR-200b/c-3p and miR-429-3p. The target prediction identified 
      3,588 potential target genes and 127 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes 
      pathways; several connected to the immune system, including TGF-b and T cell 
      receptor signaling and T-helper cell differentiation. This review highlights the 
      role of breast milk miRNAs and their potential contribution to infant immune 
      maturation. Indeed, breast milk miRNAs seem to be involved in several pathways 
      that influence oral tolerance development.

AB  - Background: Artesunate (ART), is a semi-synthetic water-soluble artemisinin 
      derivative extracted from the plant Artemisia annua, which is often used to 
      treating malaria. In vivo and in vitro studies suggested it may help decrease 
      inflammation and attenuate airway remodeling in asthma. However, its underlying 
      mechanism of action is not elucidated yet. Herein, an attempt is made to 
      investigate the ART molecular mechanism in treating asthma. Methods: The BALB/c 
      female mice sensitized via ovalbumin (OVA) have been utilized to establish the 
      asthma model, followed by carrying out ART interventions. Lung inflammation 
      scores by Haematoxylin and Eosin (H&E), goblet cell hyperplasia grade by Periodic 
      Acid-Schiff (PAS), and collagen fibers deposition by Masson trichrome staining 
      have been utilized for evaluating how ART affected asthma. RNA-sequencing 
      (RNA-seq) analyses were performed to identify differentially expressed genes 
      (DEGs). The DEGs were analyzed by Gene Ontology (GO) terms, Kyoto Encyclopedia of 
      Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways, and Protein-Protein interaction (PPI) function 
      analyses. Hub clusters were found by Cytoscape MCODE. Subsequently, Real-Time 
      quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) verified the mRNA expression profiles of DEGs. 
      Finally, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and western blots have validated the relevant 
      genes and potential pathways. Results: ART considerably attenuated inflammatory 
      cell infiltration, mucus secretion, and collagen fibers deposition. KEGG pathway 
      analysis revealed that the ART played a protective role via various pathways 
      including the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway as one of them. 
      Moreover, ART could alleviate the overexpression of found in inflammatory zone 
      1(FIZZ1) as revealed by IHC and Western blot analyses. ART attenuated OVA-induced 
      asthma by downregulating phosphorylated p38 MAPK. Conclusion: ART exerted a 
      protective function in a multitarget and multi-pathway on asthma. FIZZ1 was a 
      possible target for asthma airway remodeling. The MARK pathway was one of the key 
      pathways by which ART protected against asthma.

AB  - COVID-19 induces chromatin remodeling in host immune cells, and it had previously 
      been shown that vitamin B12 downregulates some inflammatory genes via 
      methyl-dependent epigenetic mechanisms. In this work, whole blood cultures from 
      moderate or severe COVID-19 patients were used to assess the potential of B12 as 
      adjuvant drug. The vitamin normalized the expression of a panel of inflammatory 
      genes still dysregulated in the leukocytes despite glucocorticoid therapy during 
      hospitalization. B12 also increased the flux of the sulfur amino acid pathway, 
      that regulates the bioavailability of methyl. Accordingly, B12-induced 
      downregulation of CCL3 strongly and negatively correlated with the 
      hypermethylation of CpGs in its regulatory regions. Transcriptome analysis 
      revealed that B12 attenuates the effects of COVID-19 on most inflammation-related 
      pathways affected by the disease. As far as we are aware, this is the first study 
      to demonstrate that pharmacological modulation of epigenetic markings in 
      leukocytes favorably regulates central components of COVID-19 physiopathology.

TI  - The Genetic and Epigenetic Features of Bilateral Wilms Tumor Predisposition: A 
      Report from the Children's Oncology Group AREN18B5-Q Study.
LID - rs.3.rs-2675436 [pii]
LID - 10.21203/rs.3.rs-2675436/v1 [doi]
AB  - This study comprehensively evaluated the landscape of genetic and epigenetic 
      events that predispose to synchronous bilateral Wilms tumor (BWT). We performed 
      whole exome or whole genome sequencing, total-strand RNA-seq, and DNA methylation 
      analysis using germline and/or tumor samples from 68 patients with BWT from St. 
      Jude Children's Research Hospital and the Children's Oncology Group. We found 
      that 25/61 (41%) of patients evaluated harbored pathogenic or likely pathogenic 
      germline variants, with WT1 (14.8%), NYNRIN (6.6%), TRIM28 (5%) and the 
      BRCA-related genes (5%) BRCA1 , BRCA2 , and PALB2 being most common. Germline WT1 
      variants were strongly associated with somatic paternal uniparental disomy 
      encompassing the 11p15.5 and 11p13/ WT1 loci and subsequent acquired pathogenic 
      CTNNB1 variants. Somatic coding variants or genome-wide copy number alterations 
      were almost never shared between paired synchronous BWT, suggesting that the 
      acquisition of independent somatic variants leads to tumor formation in the 
      context of germline or early embryonic, post-zygotic initiating events. In 
      contrast, 11p15.5 status (loss of heterozygosity, loss or retention of 
      imprinting) was shared among paired synchronous BWT in all but one case. The 
      predominant molecular events for BWT predisposition include pathogenic germline 
      variants or post-zygotic epigenetic hypermethylation at the 11p15.5 H19/ICR1 
      locus (loss of imprinting). This study demonstrates that post-zygotic somatic 
      mosaicism for 11p15.5 hypermethylation/loss of imprinting is the single most 
      common initiating molecular event predisposing to BWT. Evidence of somatic 
      mosaicism for 11p15.5 loss of imprinting was detected in leukocytes of a cohort 
      of BWT patients and long-term survivors, but not in unilateral Wilms tumor 
      patients and long-term survivors or controls, further supporting the hypothesis 
      that post-zygotic 11p15.5 alterations occurred in the mesoderm of patients who go 
      on to develop BWT. Due to the preponderance of BWT patients with demonstrable 
      germline or early embryonic tumor predisposition, BWT exhibits a unique biology 
      when compared to unilateral Wilms tumor and therefore warrants continued 
      refinement of its own treatment-relevant biomarkers which in turn may inform 
      directed treatment strategies in the future.

AB  - Identifying spatially variable genes (SVGs) is critical in linking molecular cell 
      functions with tissue phenotypes. Spatially resolved transcriptomics captures 
      cellular-level gene expression with corresponding spatial coordinates in two or 
      three dimensions and can be used to infer SVGs effectively. However, current 
      computational methods may not achieve reliable results and often cannot handle 
      three-dimensional spatial transcriptomic data. Here we introduce BSP (big-small 
      patch), a spatial granularity-guided and non-parametric model to identify SVGs 
      from two or three-dimensional spatial transcriptomics data in a fast and robust 
      manner. This new method has been extensively tested in simulations, demonstrating 
      superior accuracy, robustness, and high efficiency. BSP is further validated by 
      substantiated biological discoveries in cancer, neural science, rheumatoid 
      arthritis, and kidney studies with various types of spatial transcriptomics 
      technologies.

TI  - Proteomic Analysis Reveals Changes in Tight Junctions in the Small Intestinal 
      Epithelium of Mice Fed a High-Fat Diet.
LID - 10.3390/nu15061473 [doi]
LID - 1473
AB  - The impact of a high-fat diet (HFD) on intestinal permeability has been well 
      established. When bacteria and their metabolites from the intestinal tract flow 
      into the portal vein, inflammation in the liver is triggered. However, the exact 
      mechanism behind the development of a leaky gut caused by an HFD is unclear. In 
      this study, we investigated the mechanism underlying the leaky gut related to an 
      HFD. C57BL/6J mice were fed an HFD or control diet for 24 weeks, and their small 
      intestine epithelial cells (IECs) were analyzed using deep quantitative 
      proteomics. A significant increase in fat accumulation in the liver and a trend 
      toward increased intestinal permeability were observed in the HFD group compared 
      to the control group. Proteomics analysis of the upper small intestine epithelial 
      cells identified 3684 proteins, of which 1032 were differentially expressed 
      proteins (DEPs). Functional analysis of DEPs showed significant enrichment of 
      proteins related to endocytosis, protein transport, and tight junctions (TJ). 
      Expression of Cldn7 was inversely correlated with intestinal barrier function and 
      strongly correlated with that of Epcam. This study will make important 
      foundational contributions by providing a comprehensive depiction of protein 
      expression in IECs affected by HFD, including an indication that the Epcam/Cldn7 
      complex plays a role in leaky gut.

TI  - Computational Approaches Drive Developments in Immune-Oncology Therapies for 
      PD-1/PD-L1 Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors.

LID - 5908
AB  - Computational approaches in immune-oncology therapies focus on using data-driven 
      methods to identify potential immune targets and develop novel drug candidates. 
      In particular, the search for PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has 
      enlivened the field, leveraging the use of cheminformatics and bioinformatics 
      tools to analyze large datasets of molecules, gene expression and protein-protein 
      interactions. Up to now, there is still an unmet clinical need for improved ICIs 
      and reliable predictive biomarkers. In this review, we highlight the 
      computational methodologies applied to discovering and developing PD-1/PD-L1 ICIs 
      for improved cancer immunotherapies with a greater focus in the last five years. 
      The use of computer-aided drug design structure- and ligand-based virtual 
      screening processes, molecular docking, homology modeling and molecular dynamics 
      simulations methodologies essential for successful drug discovery campaigns 
      focusing on antibodies, peptides or small-molecule ICIs are addressed. A list of 
      recent databases and web tools used in the context of cancer and immunotherapy 
      has been compilated and made available, namely regarding a general scope, cancer 
      and immunology. In summary, computational approaches have become valuable tools 
      for discovering and developing ICIs. Despite significant progress, there is still 
      a need for improved ICIs and biomarkers, and recent databases and web tools have 
      been compiled to aid in this pursuit.

TI  - Analysis of Genome Structure and Its Variations in Potato Cultivars Grown in 
      Russia.
LID - 10.3390/ijms24065713 [doi]
LID - 5713
AB  - Solanum tuberosum L. (common potato) is one of the most important crops produced 
      almost all over the world. Genomic sequences of potato opens the way for studying 
      the molecular variations related to diversification. We performed a 
      reconstruction of genomic sequences for 15 tetraploid potato cultivars grown in 
      Russia using short reads. Protein-coding genes were identified; conserved and 
      variable parts of pan-genome and the repertoire of the NBS-LRR genes were 
      characterized. For comparison, we used additional genomic sequences for twelve 
      South American potato accessions, performed analysis of genetic diversity, and 
      identified the copy number variations (CNVs) in two these groups of potato. 
      Genomes of Russian potato cultivars were more homogeneous by CNV characteristics 
      and have smaller maximum deletion size in comparison with South American ones. 
      Genes with different CNV occurrences in two these groups of potato accessions 
      were identified. We revealed genes of immune/abiotic stress response, transport 
      and five genes related to tuberization and photoperiod control among them. Four 
      genes related to tuberization and photoperiod were investigated in potatoes 
      previously (phytochrome A among them). A novel gene, homologous to the 
      poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG) of Arabidopsis, was identified that may be 
      involved in circadian rhythm control and contribute to the acclimatization 
      processes of Russian potato cultivars.

TI  - Arsenite Exposure to Human RPCs (HRTPT) Produces a Reversible Epithelial 
      Mesenchymal Transition (EMT): In-Vitro and In-Silico Study.
LID - 10.3390/ijms24065092 [doi]
LID - 5092
AB  - The human kidney is known to possess renal progenitor cells (RPCs) that can 
      assist in the repair of acute tubular injury. The RPCs are sparsely located as 
      single cells throughout the kidney. We recently generated an immortalized human 
      renal progenitor cell line (HRTPT) that co-expresses PROM1/CD24 and expresses 
      features expected on RPCs. This included the ability to form nephrospheres, 
      differentiate on the surface of Matrigel, and undergo adipogenic, neurogenic, and 
      osteogenic differentiation. These cells were used in the present study to 
      determine how the cells would respond when exposed to nephrotoxin. Inorganic 
      arsenite (iAs) was chosen as the nephrotoxin since the kidney is susceptible to 
      this toxin and there is evidence of its involvement in renal disease. Gene 
      expression profiles when the cells were exposed to iAs for 3, 8, and 10 passages 
      (subcultured at 1:3 ratio) identified a shift from the control unexposed cells. 
      The cells exposed to iAs for eight passages were then referred with growth media 
      containing no iAs and within two passages the cells returned to an epithelial 
      morphology with strong agreement in differential gene expression between control 
      and cells recovered from iAs exposure. Results show within three serial passages 
      of the cells exposed to iAs there was a shift in morphology from an epithelial to 
      a mesenchymal phenotype. EMT was suggested based on an increase in known 
      mesenchymal markers. We found RPCs can undergo EMT when exposed to a nephrotoxin 
      and undergo MET when the agent is removed from the growth media.

TI  - Coronatine-Based Gene Expression Changes Impart Partial Resistance to Fall 
      Armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda) in Seedling Maize.
LID - 10.3390/genes14030735 [doi]

AB  - In recent years, Spodoptera frugiperda (S. frugiperda, Smith) has invaded China, 
      seriously threatening maize production. To explore an effective method to curb 
      the further expansion of the harm of the S. frugiperda, this experiment used 
      maize seedlings of the Zhengdan 958 three-leaf stage (V3) of maize as the 
      material to study the effect of coronatine (COR) on the ability of maize to 
      resist insects (S. frugiperda) at the seedling stage. The results showed that 
      when maize was sprayed with 0.05 μM COR, the newly incubated larvae of S. 
      frugiperda had the least leaf feeding. It was found that 0.05 μM COR 
      significantly increased the contents of abscisic acid (ABA) and jasmonate (JA) in 
      maize leaves through the determination of hormone content. Moreover, 
      transcriptome sequencing revealed that the expression of six genes (ZmBX1, ZmBX2, 
      ZmBX3, ZmBX4, ZmBX5 and ZmBX6), which are associated with the synthesis of 
      benzoxazinoid, were upregulated. Nine genes (ZmZIM3, ZmZIM4, ZmZIM10, ZmZIM13, 
      ZmZIM18, ZmZIM23, ZmZIM27, ZmZIM28 and ZmZIM38) of JA-Zim Domain (JAZ) protein in 
      the JA signal pathway, and seven genes (ZmPRH19, ZmPRH18, Zm00001d024732, 
      Zm00001d034109, Zm00001d026269, Zm00001d028574 and Zm00001d013220) of ABA 
      downstream response protein Group A Type 2C Protein Phosphatase (PP2C) were 
      downregulated. These results demonstrated that COR could induce anti-insect 
      factors and significantly improve insect resistance in seedling maize, which laid 
      a theoretical foundation for further study of the mechanism of COR improving 
      insect resistance in seedling maize, and provided data references for the use of 
      COR as an environmentally friendly pest control method.

TI  - Stromal Senescence following Treatment with the CDK4/6 Inhibitor Palbociclib 
      Alters the Lung Metastatic Niche and Increases Metastasis of Drug-Resistant 
      Mammary Cancer Cells.
LID - 10.3390/cancers15061908 [doi]
LID - 1908
AB  - BACKGROUND: CDK4/6 inhibitors (CDKi) have improved disease control in 
      hormone-receptor-positive, HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer, but most 
      patients develop progressive disease. METHODS: We asked whether host stromal 
      senescence after CDK4/6 inhibition affects metastatic seeding and growth of 
      CDKi-resistant mammary cancer cells by using the p16-INK-ATTAC mouse model of 
      inducible senolysis. RESULTS: Palbociclib pretreatment of naïve mice increased 
      lung seeding of CDKi-resistant syngeneic mammary cancer cells, and this effect 
      was reversed by depletion of host senescent cells. RNA sequencing analyses of 
      lungs from non-tumor-bearing p16-INK-ATTAC mice identified that palbociclib 
      downregulates immune-related gene sets and gene expression related to leukocyte 
      migration. Concomitant senolysis reversed a portion of these effects, including 
      pathway-level enrichment of TGF-β- and senescence-related signaling. CIBERSORTx 
      analysis revealed that palbociclib alters intra-lung macrophage/monocyte 
      populations. Notably, lung metastases from palbociclib-pretreated mice revealed 
      senescent endothelial cells. Palbociclib-treated endothelial cells exhibit 
      hallmark senescent features in vitro, upregulate genes involved with the 
      senescence-associated secretory phenotype, leukocyte migration, and 
      TGF-β-mediated paracrine senescence and induce tumor cell migration and monocyte 
      trans-endothelial invasion in co-culture. CONCLUSIONS: These studies shed light 
      on how stromal senescence induced by palbociclib affects lung metastasis, and 
      they describe palbociclib-induced gene expression changes in the normal lung and 
      endothelial cell models that correlate with changes in the tumor microenvironment 
      in the lung metastatic niche.

TI  - MAPK Is a Mutual Pathway Targeted by Anxiety-Related miRNAs, and E2F5 Is a 
      Putative Target for Anxiolytic miRNAs.
LID - 10.3390/biom13030544 [doi]
LID - 544
AB  - Anxiety-related disorders (ARDs) are chronic neuropsychological diseases and the 
      sixth leading cause of disability in the world. As dysregulation of microRNAs 
      (miRs) are observed in the pathological course of neuropsychiatric disorders, the 
      present study aimed to introduce miRs that underlie anxiety processing in the 
      brain. First, we collected the experimentally confirmed anxiety-related miRNAs 
      (ARmiRs), predicted their target transcripts, and introduced critical cellular 
      pathways with key commune hub genes. As a result, we have found nine anxiolytic 
      and ten anxiogenic ARmiRs. The anxiolytic miRs frequently target the mRNA of 
      Acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 4 (Acsl4), AFF4-AF4/FMR2 family 
      member 4 (Aff4), and Krüppel like transcription factor 4 (Klf4) genes, where 
      miR-34b-5p and miR-34c-5p interact with all of them. Moreover, the anxiogenic 
      miRs frequently target the mRNA of nine genes; among them, only two miR 
      (miR-142-5p and miR-218-5p) have no interaction with the mRNA of trinucleotide 
      repeat-containing adaptor 6B (Tnrc6b), and miR-124-3p interacts with all of them 
      where MAPK is the main signaling pathway affected by both anxiolytic and 
      anxiogenic miR. In addition, the anxiolytic miR commonly target E2F transcription 
      factor 5 (E2F5) in the TGF-β signaling pathway, and the anxiogenic miR commonly 
      target Ataxin 1 (Atxn1), WASP-like actin nucleation promoting factor (Wasl), and 
      Solute Carrier Family 17 Member 6 (Slc17a6) genes in the notch signaling, 
      adherence junction, and synaptic vesicle cycle pathways, respectively. Taken 
      together, we conclude that the most important anxiolytic (miR-34c, Let-7d, and 
      miR-17) and anxiogenic (miR-19b, miR-92a, and 218) miR, as hub epigenetic 
      modulators, potentially influence the pathophysiology of anxiety, primarily via 
      interaction with the MAPK signaling pathway. Moreover, the role of E2F5 as a 
      novel putative target for anxiolytic miRNAs in ARDs disorders deserves further 
      exploration.

      prostate cancer.
PG  - 215
LID - 10.1038/s41419-023-05742-y [doi]

AB  - Enabled resistance or innate insensitiveness to antiandrogen are lethal for 
      castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Unfortunately, there seems to be 
      little can be done to overcome the antiandrogen resistance because of the largely 
      unknown mechanisms. In prospective cohort study, we found that HOXB3 protein 
      level was an independent risk factor of PSA progression and death in patients 
      with metastatic CRPC. In vivo, upregulated HOXB3 contributed to CRPC xenografts 
      progression and abiraterone resistance. To uncover the mechanism of HOXB3 driving 
      tumor progression, we performed RNA-sequencing in HOXB3 negative (HOXB3-) and 
      HOXB3 high (HOXB3 + ) staining CRPC tumors and determined that HOXB3 activation 
      was associated with the expression of WNT3A and enriched WNT pathway genes. 
      Furthermore, extra WNT3A and APC deficiency led HOXB3 to be isolated from 
      destruction-complex, translocated to nuclei, and then transcriptionally regulated 
      multiple WNT pathway genes. What's more, we also observed that the suppression of 
      HOXB3 could reduce cell proliferation in APC-downregulated CRPC cells and 
      sensitize APC-deficient CRPC xenografts to abiraterone again. Together, our data 
      indicated that HOXB3 served as a downstream transcription factor of WNT pathway 
      and defined a subgroup of CRPC resistant to antiandrogen which would benefit from 
      HOXB3-targeted therapy.

AB  - The cell origin-specific payloads within extracellular vesicles (EVs) mediate 
      therapeutic bioactivity for a wide variety of stem cell types. In this study, we 
      profiled the microRNA (miRNA) and protein cargos found within EVs produced by 
      three clinical-grade stem cell products of different ontogenies being considered 
      for clinical application, namely bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells 
      (BM-MSCs), heart-derived cells (HDCs), and umbilical cord-derived MSCs (UC-MSCs). 
      Although several miRNAs (757) and proteins (420) were found in common, each 
      producer cell type expressed unique miRNA profiles when the most highly expressed 
      transcripts were compared. Differential expression analysis revealed that BM-MSCs 
      and HDCs were quite similar, while UC-MSCs had the greatest number of unique 
      miRNAs and proteins. Despite these differences, all three EVs promoted cell 
      adhesion/migration, immune response, platelet aggregation, protein 
      translation/stabilization, and RNA processing. EVs from BM-MSCs were implicated 
      in apoptosis, cell-cycle progression, collagen formation, heme pigment synthesis, 
      and smooth muscle differentiation, while HDC and UC-MSC EVs were found to 
      regulate complement activation, endopeptidase activity, and matrix 
      metallopeptidases. Overall, miRNA and protein profiling reveal functional 
      differences between three leading stem cell products. These findings provide a 
      framework for mechanistic exploration of candidate therapeutic molecules driving 
      the salutary effects of EVs.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The incidence of endometrial cancer (EC) has been increasing 
      worldwide. However, because there are limited chemotherapeutic options for the 
      treatment of EC, the prognosis of advanced-stage EC is poor. METHODS: Gene 
      expression profile datasets for EC cases registered in The Cancer Genome Atlas 
      (TCGA) was reanalyzed. Highly expressed genes in advanced-stage EC (110 cases) 
      compared with early-stage EC (255 cases) were extracted and Gene Ontology (GO) 
      enrichment analysis was performed. Among the enriched genes, Kaplan-Meier (KM) 
      plotter analysis was performed. Candidate genes expression was analyzed in HEC50B 
      cells and Ishikawa cells by RT-qPCR. In HEC50B cells, LIM homeobox1 (LIM1) was 
      knocked down (KD) and cell proliferation, migration, and invasion ability of the 
      cells were evaluated. Xenografts were generated using LIM1-KD cells and tumor 
      growth was evaluated. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) of RNA-seq data using 
      LIM-KD cells was performed. Expression of phospho-CREB and CREB-related proteins 
      were evaluated in LIM1-KD cells by western blotting and in xenograft tissue by 
      immunofluorescent staining. Two different CREB inhibitors were treated in HEC50B 
      and cell proliferation was evaluated by MTT assay. RESULTS: Reanalysis of TCGA 
      followed by GO enrichment analysis revealed that homeobox genes were highly 
      expressed in advanced-stage EC. Among the identified genes, KM plotter analysis 
      showed that high LIM1 expression was associated with a significantly poorer 
      prognosis in EC. Additionally, LIM1 expression was significantly higher in 
      high-grade EC cell lines, HEC50B cells than Ishikawa cells. Knockdown of LIM1 
      showed reduced cell proliferation, migration and invasion in HEC50B cells. 
      Xenograft experiments revealed that tumor growth was significantly suppressed in 
      LIM1-KD cells. IPA of RNA-seq data using LIM-KD cells predicted that the mRNA 
      expression of CREB signaling-related genes was suppressed. Indeed, 
      phosphorylation of CREB was decreased in LIM1-KD cells and LIM1-KD cells derived 
      tumors. HEC50B cells treated by CREB inhibitors showed suppression of cell 
      proliferation. CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION: Collectively, these results suggested 
      that high LIM1 expression contributed to tumor growth via CREB signaling in EC. 
      Inhibition of LIM1 or its downstream molecules would be new therapeutic 
      strategies for EC.

TI  - Combating pancreatic cancer with ovarian cancer cells.
PG  - 2189-2207
LID - 10.18632/aging.204608 [doi]
AB  - With overall five-year survival rate less than 10%, pancreatic cancer (PC) 
      represents the most lethal one in all human cancers. Given that the incidence of 
      PC is still increasing and current cancer treatment strategies are often 
      inefficacious, its therapy is still a huge challenge. Here, we first revealed 
      ovarian serous carcinoma is mostly anti-correlated with pancreatic cancer in gene 
      expression signatures. Based on this observation, we proposed that ovarian cancer 
      cells could defend PC. To confirm this strategy, we first showed that ovarian 
      cancer cell SKOV3 can significantly inhibit the proliferation of pancreatic 
      cancer cell SW1990 when they were co-cultured. We further validated this strategy 
      by an animal model of pancreatic cancer xenografts. The result showed that the 
      injection of SKOV3 significantly inhibits pancreatic cancer xenografts. Moreover, 
      we found that SKOV3 with transgenic African elephant TP53 gene further enhances 
      the therapeutic effect. RNA-sequencing analysis revealed that the ovarian cancer 
      cell treatment strikingly induced changes of genes being involved in pancreas 
      function and phenotype (e.g. enhancing pancreas function, pancreas regeneration, 
      and cell adhesion) but not immune and inflammation-related functions, suggesting 
      that the proposed strategy is different from immunotherapy and could be a novel 
      strategy for cancer treatment.

AB  - Positively charged repeat peptides are emerging as key players in 
      neurodegenerative diseases. These peptides can perturb diverse cellular pathways 
      but a unifying framework for how such promiscuous toxicity arises has remained 
      elusive. We used mass-spectrometry-based proteomics to define the protein targets 
      of these neurotoxic peptides and found that they all share similar sequence 
      features that drive their aberrant condensation with these positively charged 
      peptides. We trained a machine learning algorithm to detect such sequence 
      features and unexpectedly discovered that this mode of toxicity is not limited to 
      human repeat expansion disorders but has evolved countless times across the tree 
      of life in the form of cationic antimicrobial and venom peptides. We demonstrate 
      that an excess in positive charge is necessary and sufficient for this killer 
      activity, which we name 'polycation poisoning'. These findings reveal an ancient 
      and conserved mechanism and inform ways to leverage its design rules for new 
      generations of bioactive peptides.

      tumors in predicting recurrence in colorectal cancer patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous investigations of transcriptomic signatures of cancer 
      patient survival and post-therapy relapse have focused on tumor tissue. In 
      contrast, here we show that in colorectal cancer (CRC) transcriptomes derived 
      from normal tissues adjacent to tumors (NATs) are better predictors of relapse. 
      RESULTS: Using the transcriptomes of paired tumor and NAT specimens from 80 
      Korean CRC patients retrospectively determined to be in recurrence or 
      nonrecurrence states, we found that, when comparing recurrent with nonrecurrent 
      samples, NATs exhibit a greater number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) 
      than tumors. Training two prognostic elastic net-based machine learning 
      models-NAT-based and tumor-based in our Samsung Medical Center (SMC) cohort, we 
      found that NAT-based model performed better in predicting the survival when the 
      model was applied to the tumor-derived transcriptomes of an independent cohort of 
      450 COAD patients in TCGA. Furthermore, compositions of tumor-infiltrating immune 
      cells in NATs were found to have better prognostic capability than in tumors. We 
      also confirmed through Cox regression analysis that in both SMC-CRC as well as in 
      TCGA-COAD cohorts, a greater proportion of genes exhibited significant hazard 
      ratio when NAT-derived transcriptome was used compared to when tumor-derived 
      transcriptome was used. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our results strongly suggest 
      that NAT-derived transcriptomes and immune cell composition of CRC are better 
      predictors of patient survival and tumor recurrence than the primary tumor.

AB  - Based on the recently added high throughput analysis data on small noncoding RNAs 
      in modulating disease pathophysiology of malaria, we performed an integrative 
      computational analysis for exploring the role of human-host erythrocytic 
      microRNAs (miRNAs) and their influence on parasite survival and host homeostasis. 
      An in silico analysis was performed on transcriptomic datasets accessed from 
      PlasmoDB and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) repositories analyzed using miRanda, 
      miRTarBase, mirDIP, and miRDB to identify the candidate miRNAs that were further 
      subjected to network analysis using MCODE and DAVID. This was followed by immune 
      infiltration analysis and screening for RNA degradation mechanisms. Seven 
      erythrocytic miRNAs, miR-451a, miR-92a-3p, miR-16-5p, miR-142-3p, miR-15b-5p, 
      miR-19b-3p, and miR-223-3p showed favourable interactions with parasite genes 
      expressed during blood stage infection. The miR-92a-3p that targeted the 
      virulence gene PfEMP1 showed drastic reduction during infection. Performing 
      pathway analysis for the human-host gene targets for the miRNA identified TOB1, 
      TOB2, CNOT4, and XRN1 genes that are associated to RNA degradation processes, 
      with the exoribonuclease XRN1, highly enriched in the malarial samples. On 
      evaluating the role of exoribonucleases in miRNA degradation further, the pattern 
      of Plasmodium falciparum_XRN1 showed increased levels during infection thus 
      suggesting a defensive role for parasite survival. This study identifies 
      miR-92a-3p, a member of C13orf25/ miR-17-92 cluster, as a novel miRNA inhibitor 
      of the crucial parasite genes responsible for symptomatic malaria. Evidence for a 
      plausible link to chromosome 13q31.3 loci controlling the epigenetic disease 
      regulation is also suggested.

AB  - Spaceflight presents a multifaceted environment for plants, combining the effects 
      on growth of many stressors and factors including altered gravity, the influence 
      of experiment hardware, and increased radiation exposure. To help understand the 
      plant response to this complex suite of factors this study compared 
      transcriptomic analysis of 15 Arabidopsis thaliana spaceflight experiments 
      deposited in the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's GeneLab data 
      repository. These data were reanalyzed for genes showing significant differential 
      expression in spaceflight versus ground controls using a single common 
      computational pipeline for either the microarray or the RNA-seq datasets. Such a 
      standardized approach to analysis should greatly increase the robustness of 
      comparisons made between datasets. This analysis was coupled with extensive 
      cross-referencing to a curated matrix of metadata associated with these 
      experiments. Our study reveals that factors such as analysis type (i.e., 
      microarray versus RNA-seq) or environmental and hardware conditions have 
      important confounding effects on comparisons seeking to define plant reactions to 
      spaceflight. The metadata matrix allows selection of studies with high similarity 
      scores, i.e., that share multiple elements of experimental design, such as plant 
      age or flight hardware. Comparisons between these studies then helps reduce the 
      complexity in drawing conclusions arising from comparisons made between 
      experiments with very different designs.

LID - 10.1097/CM9.0000000000002576 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: CD5L (CD5 molecular-like) plays an important role in lipid metabolism 
      and immune regulation. This study aimed to investigate the roles of CD5L on liver 
      hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC). METHODS: We analyzed the CD5L mRNA expression 
      and its potential prognostic value based on The Cancer Genome Atlas and Gene 
      Expression Omnibus databases. Immunohistochemical analysis was used to 
      investigate the CD5L levels in LIHC tissues. Serum CD5L levels in LIHC were 
      detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay 
      was used to investigate the effect of CD5L treatment on HepG2 and QSG-7701 cell 
      proliferation. CD5L expression correlated genes were exhumed based on the 
      LinkedOmics. Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analyses 
      for CD5L associated genes were performed. The correlation between CD5L and tumor 
      immune infiltration was analyzed by using Tumor Immune Estimation Resource 
      (TIMER) 2.0. RESULTS: CD5L mRNA and protein levels were significantly decreased 
      in LIHC tumor tissue compared with non-tumor control tissues. Moreover, serum 
      CD5L levels were significantly lower in LIHC patients than that in healthy 
      subjects. Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis 2 and Kaplan-Meier 
      plotter analysis showed that a high-CD5L expression was correlated with favorable 
      overall survival in LIHC patients, except the LIHC patients with hepatitis virus. 
      CCK-8 results showed that CD5L treatment significantly decreased HepG2 cell 
      proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner, and CD5L treatment had no 
      effect on the proliferation of non-tumor hepatocyte line QSG-7701. CD5L 
      associated genes were enriched in the immune response biological process, and 
      CD5L expression levels were positively correlated with the immune infiltrates of 
      CD8 + T cell and M1 macrophage cells but negatively correlated with CD4 + T cells 
      and M0 macrophage cell infiltration. CONCLUSIONS: Exogenous CD5L inhibits cell 
      proliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma. CD5L may act as a role of prognostic 
      marker.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of vision 
      loss in the developed world and the detection of its onset and progression are 
      based on retinal morphological assessments. MicroRNA (miRNA) have been explored 
      extensively as biomarkers for a range of neurological diseases including AMD, 
      however differences in experimental design and the complexity of human biology 
      have resulted in little overlap between studies. Using preclinical animal models 
      and clinical samples, this study employs a novel approach to determine a serum 
      signature of AMD progression. METHODS: Serum miRNAs were extracted from mice 
      exposed to photo-oxidative damage (PD; 0, 1, 3 and 5 days), and clinical samples 
      from patients diagnosed with reticular pseudodrusen or atrophic AMD. The 
      expression of ~800 miRNAs was measured using OpenArray™, and differential 
      abundance from controls was determined using the HTqPCR R package followed by 
      pathway analysis with DAVID. MiRNA expression changes were compared against 
      quantifiable retinal histological indicators. Finally, the overlap of miRNA 
      changes observed in the mouse model and human patient samples was investigated. 
      RESULTS: Differential miRNA abundance was identified at all PD time-points and in 
      clinical samples. Importantly, these were associated with inflammatory pathways 
      and histological changes in the retina. Further, we were able to align findings 
      in the mouse serum to those of clinical patients. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, 
      serum miRNAs are a valid tool as diagnostics for the early detection of retinal 
      degeneration, as they reflect key changes in retinal health. The combination of 
      pre-clinical animal models and human patient samples led to the identification of 
      a preliminary serum miRNA signature for AMD. This study is an important platform 
      for the future development of a diagnostic serum miRNA panel for the early 
      detection of retinal degeneration.

AB  - The tumor microenvironment (TME) is the source of important cues that govern 
      epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and facilitate the acquisition of 
      aggressive traits by cancer cells. It is now recognized that EMT is not a binary 
      program, and cancer cells rarely switch to a fully mesenchymal phenotype. Rather, 
      cancer cells exist in multiple hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal (E/M) states 
      responsible for cell population heterogeneity, which is advantageous for the 
      ever-changing environment during tumor development and metastasis. How are these 
      intermediate states generated and maintained is not fully understood. Here, we 
      show that direct interaction between small cell lung carcinoma cells and lung 
      fibroblasts induces a hybrid EMT phenotype in cancer cells in which several 
      mesenchymal genes involved in receptor interaction with the extracellular matrix 
      (ECM) and ECM remodeling are upregulated while epithelial genes such as 
      E-cadherin remain unchanged or slightly increase. We also demonstrate that 
      several core EMT-regulating transcription factors (EMT-TFs) are upregulated in 
      cancer cells during direct contact with fibroblasts, as is Yes-associated protein 
      (YAP1), a major regulator of the Hippo pathway. Further, we show that these 
      changes are transient and reverse to the initial state once the interaction is 
      disrupted. Altogether, our results provide evidence that tumor cells' direct 
      contact with the fibroblasts in the TME initiates a signaling cascade responsible 
      for hybrid E/M states of cancer cells. These hybrid states are maintained during 
      the interaction and possibly contribute to therapy resistance and immune evasion, 
      while interference with direct contact will result in slow recovery and switch to 
      the initial states.

AB  - Immune cells are highly heterogeneous and show diverse phenotypes, but the 
      underlying mechanism remains to be elucidated. In this study, we proposed a 
      theoretical framework for immune cell phenotypic classification based on gene 
      plasticity, which herein refers to expressional change or variability in response 
      to conditions. The system contains two core points. One is that the functional 
      subsets of immune cells can be further divided into subdivisions based on their 
      highly plastic genes, and the other is that loss of phenotype accompanies gain of 
      phenotype during phenotypic conversion. The first point suggests phenotypic 
      stratification or layerability according to gene plasticity, while the second 
      point reveals expressional compatibility and mutual exclusion during the change 
      in gene plasticity states. Abundant transcriptome data analysis in this study 
      from both microarray and RNA sequencing in human CD4 and CD8 single-positive T 
      cells, B cells, natural killer cells and monocytes supports the logical 
      rationality and generality, as well as expansibility, across immune cells. A 
      collection of thousands of known immunophenotypes reported in the literature 
      further supports that highly plastic genes play an important role in maintaining 
      immune cell phenotypes and reveals that the current classification model is 
      compatible with the traditionally defined functional subsets. The system provides 
      a new perspective to understand the characteristics of dynamic, diversified 
      immune cell phenotypes and intrinsic regulation in the immune system. Moreover, 
      the current substantial results based on plasticitomics analysis of bulk and 
      single-cell sequencing data provide a useful resource for big-data-driven 
      experimental studies and knowledge discoveries.

AB  - Background: Regulation of nutrient status during fasting and refeeding plays an 
      important role in maintaining metabolic homeostasis in the liver. Thus, we 
      investigated the impact of the physiological Fed-Fast-Refed cycle on hepatic gene 
      expression in nutrient-sensitive mice. Methods: We performed transcriptomic 
      analysis of liver samples in fed, fasted and refed groups of mice. Through 
      mRNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) and miRNA-Seq, we compared fasted and fed states 
      (fasted versus fed cohort) as well as refed and fasted states (refed versus 
      fasted cohort) to detect dynamic alterations of hepatic mRNA-miRNA expression 
      during the fed-fasted-refed cycle. Results: We found dozens of dysregulated 
      mRNAs-miRNAs in the transition from fed to fasted and from fasted to refed 
      states. Gene set enrichment analysis showed that gene expression of the two 
      cohorts shared common pathways of regulation, especially for lipid and protein 
      metabolism. We identified eight significant mRNA and three miRNA clusters that 
      were up-downregulated or down-upregulated during the Fed-Fast-Refed cycle. A 
      protein-protein interaction network of dysregulated mRNAs was constructed and 
      clustered into 22 key modules. The regulation between miRNAs and target mRNAs was 
      presented in a network. Up to 42 miRNA-mRNA-pathway pairs were identified to be 
      involved in metabolism. In lipid metabolism, there were significant correlations 
      between mmu-miR-296-5p and Cyp2u1 and between mmu-miR-novel-chr19_16777 and 
      Acsl3. Conclusion: Collectively, our data provide a valuable resource for the 
      molecular characterization of the physiological Fed-Fast-Refed cycle in the 
      liver.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The incidence and mortality of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are 
      globally on the rise. Dihydrotanshinone I, a natural product isolated from Salvia 
      miltiorrhiza Bunge, has attracted extensive attention in recent years for its 
      anti-tumour proliferation efficiency. METHODS: Cell proliferations in hepatoma 
      cells (Huh-7 and HepG2) were evaluated by MTT and colony formation assays. 
      Immunofluorescence (IF) of 53BP1 and flow cytometry analysis were performed to 
      detect DNA damage and cell apoptosis. Furthermore, network pharmacological 
      analysis was applied to explore the potential therapeutic targets and pathway of 
      dihydrotanshinone I. RESULTS: The results showed that dihydrotanshinone I 
      effectively inhibited the proliferation of Huh-7 and HepG2 cells. Moreover, 
      dihydrotanshinone I dose-dependently induced DNA-damage and apoptosis in vitro. 
      Network pharmacological analysis and molecular simulation results indicated that 
      EGFR might be a potential therapeutic target of dihydrotanshinone I in HCC. 
      Collectively, our findings suggested that dihydrotanshinone I is a novel 
      candidate therapeutic agent for HCC treatment.

AB  - Adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) is an important tumor suppressor and is mostly 
      linked to the regulation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. APC mutation has 
      been identified as an early event in more than 80% of sporadic colorectal cancers 
      (CRCs). Moreover, prognostic differences are observed in CRC patients with APC 
      mutations. Although previous genomics studies have investigated the roles of 
      concomitant gene mutations in determining the phenotypic heterogeneity of 
      APC-mutant tumors, valuable prognostic determinants for APC-mutant CRC patients 
      are still lacking. Based on the proteome and phosphoproteome data, we classified 
      APC-mutant colon cancer patients and revealed genomic, proteomic, and 
      phosphoproteomic heterogeneity in APC-mutant tumors. More importantly, we 
      identified RAI14 as a key prognostic determinant for APC-mutant but not 
      APC-wildtype colon cancer patients. The heterogeneity and the significance of 
      prognostic biomarkers in APC-mutant tumors were further validated in the Clinical 
      Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) colon cancer cohort. In addition, we 
      found that colon cancer patients with high expression of RAI14 were less 
      responsive to chemotherapy. Knockdown of RAI14 in cell lines led to reduced cell 
      migration and changes in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related markers. 
      Mechanistically, knockdown of RAI14 remodeled the phosphoproteome associated with 
      cell adhesion, which might affect EMT marker expression and promote F-actin 
      degradation. Collectively, this work describes the phenotypic heterogeneity of 
      APC-mutant tumors and identifies RAI14 as an important prognostic determinant for 
      APC-mutant colon cancer patients. The prognostic utility of RAI14 in APC-mutant 
      colon cancer will provide early warning and increase the chance of successful 
      treatment.

TI  - Pioneer factor ASCL1 cooperates with the mSWI/SNF complex at distal regulatory 
      elements to regulate human neural differentiation.
PG  - 218-242
LID - 10.1101/gad.350269.122 [doi]
AB  - Pioneer transcription factors are thought to play pivotal roles in developmental 
      processes by binding nucleosomal DNA to activate gene expression, though 
      mechanisms through which pioneer transcription factors remodel chromatin remain 
      unclear. Here, using single-cell transcriptomics, we show that endogenous 
      expression of neurogenic transcription factor ASCL1, considered a classical 
      pioneer factor, defines a transient population of progenitors in human neural 
      differentiation. Testing ASCL1's pioneer function using a knockout model to 
      define the unbound state, we found that endogenous expression of ASCL1 drives 
      progenitor differentiation by cis-regulation both as a classical pioneer factor 
      and as a nonpioneer remodeler, where ASCL1 binds permissive chromatin to induce 
      chromatin conformation changes. ASCL1 interacts with BAF SWI/SNF chromatin 
      remodeling complexes, primarily at targets where it acts as a nonpioneer factor, 
      and we provide evidence for codependent DNA binding and remodeling at a subset of 
      ASCL1 and SWI/SNF cotargets. Our findings provide new insights into ASCL1 
      function regulating activation of long-range regulatory elements in human 
      neurogenesis and uncover a novel mechanism of its chromatin remodeling function 
      codependent on partner ATPase activity.

AB  - Background: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a fatal and irreversible 
      interstitial lung disease. The specific mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis 
      of IPF are not fully understood, while metabolic dysregulation has recently been 
      demonstrated to contribute to IPF. This study aims to identify key 
      metabolism-related genes involved in the progression of IPF, providing new 
      insights into the pathogenesis of IPF. Methods: We downloaded four datasets 
      (GSE32537, GSE110147, GSE150910, and GSE92592) from the Gene Expression Omnibus 
      (GEO) database and identified differentially expressed metabolism-related genes 
      (DEMRGs) in lung tissues of IPF by comprehensive analysis. Then, we performed GO, 
      KEGG, and Reactome enrichment analyses of the DEMRGs. Subsequently, key DEMRGs 
      were identified by machine-learning algorithms. Next, miRNAs regulating these key 
      DEMRGs were predicted by integrating the GSE32538 (IPF miRNA dataset) and the 
      miRWalk database. The Cytoscape software was used to visualize miRNA-mRNA 
      regulatory networks. In addition, the relative levels of immune cells were 
      assessed by the CIBERSORT algorithm, and the correlation of key DEMRGs with 
      immune cells was calculated. Finally, the mRNA expression of the key DEMRGs was 
      validated in two external independent datasets and an in vivo experiment. 
      Results: A total of 101 DEMRGs (51 upregulated and 50 downregulated) were 
      identified. Six key DEMRGs (ENPP3, ENTPD1, GPX3, PDE7B, PNMT, and POLR3H) were 
      further identified using two machine-learning algorithms (LASSO and SVM-RFE). In 
      the lung tissue of IPF patients, the expression levels of ENPP3, ENTPD1, and 
      PDE7B were upregulated, and the expression levels of GPX3, PNMT, and POLR3H were 
      downregulated. In addition, the miRNA-mRNA regulatory network of key DEMRGs was 
      constructed. Then, the expression levels of key DEMRGs were validated in two 
      independent external datasets (GSE53845 and GSE213001). Finally, we verified the 
      key DEMRGs in the lung tissue of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis mice by 
      qRT-PCR. Conclusion: Our study identified key metabolism-related genes that are 
      differentially expressed in the lung tissue of IPF patients. Our study emphasizes 
      the critical role of metabolic dysregulation in IPF, offers potential therapeutic 
      targets, and provides new insights for future studies.

AB  - Egg yolk constitutes about a third of the structure of the chicken egg however, 
      the molecular structure and physiological effects of egg yolk-derived lipid 
      membranous vesicles are not clearly understood. In this study, for the first 
      record, the egg yolk nanovesicles (vitellovesicles, VVs) were isolated, 
      characterized, and used as a supplement for porcine embryo culture. Yolks of ten 
      freshly oviposited eggs were filtered and ultracentrifuged at 100,000 × g for 3 h 
      to obtain a pellet. Cryogenic transmission electron microscopy and nanoparticle 
      tracking analysis of the pellet revealed bilipid membranous vesicles. Protein 
      contents of the pellet were analyzed using tandem mass spectrometry and the miRNA 
      content was also profiled through BGISEQ-500 sequencer. VVs were supplemented 
      with the in vitro culture medium of day-7 hatched parthenogenetic blastocysts. 
      After 2 days of blastocyst culture, the embryonic cell count was increased in VVs 
      supplemented embryos in comparison to the non-supplemented embryos. TUNEL assay 
      showed that apoptotic cells were increased in control groups when compared with 
      the VVs supplemented group. Reduced glutathione was increased by 2.5 folds in the 
      VVs supplemented group while reactive oxygen species were increased by 5.3 folds 
      in control groups. Quantitative PCR analysis showed that VVs significantly 
      increased the expression of lipid metabolism-associated genes (monoglyceride 
      lipase and lipase E), anti-apoptotic gene (BCL2), and superoxide dismutase, while 
      significantly reducing apoptotic gene (BAX). Culturing embryos on Matrigel 
      basement membrane matrix indicated that VVs significantly enhanced embryo 
      attachment and embryonic stem cell outgrowths compared to the non-supplemented 
      group. This considers the first report to characterize the molecular bioactive 
      cargo contents of egg yolk nanovesicles to show their embryotrophic effect on 
      mammalian embryos. This effect might be attributed to the protein and miRNA cargo 
      contents of VVs. VVs can be used for the formulation of in vitro culture medium 
      for mammalian embryos including humans.

TI  - Identifying Key Lysosome-Related Genes Associated with Drug-Resistant Breast 
      Cancer Using Computational and Systems Biology Approach.
PG  - e130342

AB  - BACKGROUND: Drug resistance in breast cancer is an unsolved problem in treating 
      patients. It has been recently discussed that lysosomes contribute to the 
      invasion and angiogenesis of cancer cells. There is evidence that lysosomes can 
      also cause multi-drug resistance. We analyzed this emerging concept in breast 
      cancer through computational and systems biology approaches. OBJECTIVES: We aimed 
      to identify the key lysosome-related genes associated with drug-resistant breast 
      cancer. METHODS: All genes contributing to the structure and function of 
      lysosomes were inquired through the Human Lysosome Gene Database. The prioritized 
      top 51 genes from the provided lists of Endeavour, ToppGene, and GPSy as 
      prioritization tools were selected. All lysosomal genes and 12 breast 
      cancer-related genes aligned to identify the most similar genes to breast 
      cancer-related genes. Different centralities were applied to score each human 
      protein to calculate the most central lysosomal genes in the human 
      protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. Common genes were extracted from the 
      results of the mentioned methods as a selected gene set. For Gene Ontology 
      enrichment, the selected gene set was analyzed by WebGestalt, DAVID, and KOBAS. 
      The PPI network was constructed via the STRING database. The PPI network was 
      analyzed utilizing Cytoscape for topology network interaction and CytoHubba to 
      extract hub genes. RESULTS: Based on biological studies, literature reviews, and 
      comparing all mentioned analyzing methods, six genes were introduced as essential 
      in breast cancer. This computational approach to all lysosome-related genes 
      suggested that candidate genes include PRF1, TLR9, CLTC, GJA1, AP3B1, and RPTOR. 
      The analyses of these six genes suggest that they may have a crucial role in 
      breast cancer development, which has rarely been evaluated. These genes have a 
      potential therapeutic implication for new drug discovery for chemo-resistant 
      breast cancer. CONCLUSIONS: The present work focused on all the functional and 
      structural lysosome-related genes associated with breast cancer. It revealed the 
      top six lysosome hub genes that might serve as therapeutic targets in 
      drug-resistant breast cancer. Since these genes play a pivotal role in the 
      structure and function of lysosomes, targeting them can effectively overcome drug 
      resistance.

      antibiotic-resistance and expression of virulence determinants in Neisseria 
      gonorrhoeae.

AB  - Due to the increased resistance to all available antibiotics and the lack of 
      vaccines, Neisseria gonorrhoeae (the gonococcus) poses an urgent threat. Although 
      the mechanisms of virulence and antibiotic resistance have been largely 
      investigated in this bacterium, very few studies have addressed the stringent 
      response (SR) that in pathogenic bacteria controls the expression of genes 
      involved in host-pathogen interaction and tolerance and persistence toward 
      antibiotics. In this study, the results of the transcriptome analysis of a 
      clinical isolate of N. gonorrhoeae, after induction of the SR by serine 
      hydroxamate, provided us with an accurate list of genes that are 
      transcriptionally modulated during the SR. The list includes genes associated 
      with metabolism, cellular machine functions, host-pathogen interaction, genome 
      plasticity, and antibiotic tolerance and persistence. Moreover, we found that the 
      artificial induction of the SR in N. gonorrhoeae by serine hydroxamate is 
      prevented by thiostrepton, a thiopeptide antibiotic that is known to interact 
      with ribosomal protein L11, thereby inhibiting functions of EF-Tu and EF-G, and 
      binding of pppGpp synthase I (RelA) to ribosome upon entry of uncharged tRNA. We 
      found that N. gonorrhoeae is highly sensitive to thiostrepton under in vitro 
      conditions, and that thiostrepton, in contrast to other antibiotics, does not 
      induce tolerance or persistence. Finally, we observed that thiostrepton 
      attenuated the expression of key genes involved in the host-pathogen interaction. 
      These properties make thiostrepton a good drug candidate for dampening bacterial 
      virulence and preventing antibiotic tolerance and persistence. The ongoing 
      challenge is to increase the bioavailability of thiostrepton through the use of 
      chemistry and nanotechnology.

TI  - Proteome integral solubility alteration high-throughput proteomics assay 
      identifies Collectin-12 as a non-apoptotic microglial caspase-3 substrate.
PG  - 192

AB  - Caspases are a family of proteins mostly known for their role in the activation 
      of the apoptotic pathway leading to cell death. In the last decade, caspases have 
      been found to fulfill other tasks regulating the cell phenotype independently to 
      cell death. Microglia are the immune cells of the brain responsible for the 
      maintenance of physiological brain functions but can also be involved in disease 
      progression when overactivated. We have previously described non-apoptotic roles 
      of caspase-3 (CASP3) in the regulation of the inflammatory phenotype of 
      microglial cells or pro-tumoral activation in the context of brain tumors. CASP3 
      can regulate protein functions by cleavage of their target and therefore could 
      have multiple substrates. So far, identification of CASP3 substrates has been 
      performed mostly in apoptotic conditions where CASP3 activity is highly 
      upregulated and these approaches do not have the capacity to uncover CASP3 
      substrates at the physiological level. In our study, we aim at discovering novel 
      substrates of CASP3 involved in the normal regulation of the cell. We used an 
      unconventional approach by chemically reducing the basal level CASP3-like 
      activity (by DEVD-fmk treatment) coupled to a Mass Spectrometry screen (PISA) to 
      identify proteins with different soluble amounts, and consequently, non-cleaved 
      proteins in microglia cells. PISA assay identified several proteins with 
      significant change in their solubility after DEVD-fmk treatment, including a few 
      already known CASP3 substrates which validated our approach. Among them, we 
      focused on the Collectin-12 (COLEC12 or CL-P1) transmembrane receptor and 
      uncovered a potential role for CASP3 cleavage of COLEC12 in the regulation of the 
      phagocytic capacity of microglial cells. Taken together, these findings suggest a 
      new way to uncover non-apoptotic substrates of CASP3 important for the modulation 
      of microglia cell physiology.

AB  - Organ development involves the sustained production of diverse cell types with 
      spatiotemporal precision. In the vertebrate jaw, neural-crest-derived progenitors 
      produce not only skeletal tissues but also later-forming tendons and salivary 
      glands. Here we identify the pluripotency factor Nr5a2 as essential for cell-fate 
      decisions in the jaw. In zebrafish and mice, we observe transient expression of 
      Nr5a2 in a subset of mandibular postmigratory neural-crest-derived cells. In 
      zebrafish nr5a2 mutants, nr5a2-expressing cells that would normally form tendons 
      generate excess jaw cartilage. In mice, neural-crest-specific Nr5a2 loss results 
      in analogous skeletal and tendon defects in the jaw and middle ear, as well as 
      salivary gland loss. Single-cell profiling shows that Nr5a2, distinct from its 
      roles in pluripotency, promotes jaw-specific chromatin accessibility and gene 
      expression that is essential for tendon and gland fates. Thus, repurposing of 
      Nr5a2 promotes connective tissue fates to generate the full repertoire of 
      derivatives required for jaw and middle ear function.

TI  - The Effect of Human and Bovine Milk Osteopontin on Intestinal Caco-2 Cells: A 
      Transcriptome Comparison.
LID - 10.3390/nu15051166 [doi]
LID - 1166
AB  - Osteopontin (OPN) is a multifunctional protein abundantly present in human milk, 
      whereas the concentration is significantly lower in bovine milk. Human and bovine 
      milk OPN are structurally similar and both proteins resist gastric digestion and 
      reach the intestines in a bioactive form. Intervention studies have indicated the 
      beneficial effects of supplementing infant formula with bovine milk OPN and 
      several in vivo and in vitro studies have shown that bovine milk OPN positively 
      influences intestinal development. To investigate the functional relationship, we 
      compared the effect of simulated gastrointestinal digested human and bovine milk 
      OPN on gene expression in Caco-2 cells. After incubation, total RNA was extracted 
      and sequenced and transcripts were mapped to the human genome. Human and bovine 
      milk OPN regulated the expression of 239 and 322 genes, respectively. A total of 
      131 genes were similarly regulated by the OPNs. As a control, a whey protein 
      fraction with a high content of alpha-lactalbumin had a very limited 
      transcriptional impact on the cells. Enrichment data analysis showed that 
      biological processes related to the ubiquitin system, DNA binding, and genes 
      associated with transcription and transcription control pathways were affected by 
      the OPNs. Collectively, this study shows that human and bovine milk OPN have a 
      significant and highly comparable effect on the intestinal transcriptome.

TI  - Elucidation of Phytochemicals Affecting Platelet Responsiveness in Dangguisu-san: 
      Active Ingredient Prediction and Experimental Research Using Network 
      Pharmacology.
LID - 10.3390/plants12051120 [doi]
LID - 1120
AB  - Plant-derived phytochemicals are emerging as novel agents for protection against 
      chronic disorders. Dangguisu-san is a herbal prescription to invigorate the blood 
      and relieve pain. Among the numerous active constituents of Dangguisu-san, those 
      expected to be effective at inhibiting platelet aggregation were predicted using 
      a network pharmacological method, and their efficacy was experimentally 
      demonstrated. All four identified chemical components, namely chrysoeriol, 
      apigenin, luteolin, and sappanchalcone, suppressed the aggregation of platelets 
      to a certain extent. However, we report, for the first time, that chrysoeriol 
      acts as a strong inhibitor of platelet aggregation. Although additional in vivo 
      studies are needed, among the complex constituents of herbal medicines, the 
      components that exert an inhibitory effect on platelet aggregation were predicted 
      using a network pharmacological method and experimentally confirmed with human 
      platelets.

TI  - Reproductive Suppression Caused by Spermatogenic Arrest: Transcriptomic Evidence 
      from a Non-Social Animal.
LID - 10.3390/ijms24054611 [doi]
LID - 4611
AB  - Reproductive suppression is an adaptive strategy in animal reproduction. The 
      mechanism of reproductive suppression has been studied in social animals, 
      providing an essential basis for understanding the maintenance and development of 
      population stability. However, little is known about it in solitary animals. The 
      plateau zokor is a dominant, subterranean, solitary rodent in the Qinghai-Tibet 
      Plateau. However, the mechanism of reproductive suppression in this animal is 
      unknown. We perform morphological, hormonal, and transcriptomic assays on the 
      testes of male plateau zokors in breeders, in non-breeders, and in the 
      non-breeding season. We found that the testes of non-breeders are smaller in 
      weight and have lower serum testosterone levels than those of breeders, and the 
      mRNA expression levels of the anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) and its transcription 
      factors are significantly higher in non-breeder testes. Genes related to 
      spermatogenesis are significantly downregulated in both meiotic and post-meiotic 
      stages in non-breeders. Genes related to the meiotic cell cycle, spermatogenesis, 
      flagellated sperm motility, fertilization, and sperm capacitation are 
      significantly downregulated in non-breeders. Our data suggest that high levels of 
      AMH may lead to low levels of testosterone, resulting in delayed testicular 
      development, and physiological reproductive suppression in plateau zokor. This 
      study enriches our understanding of reproductive suppression in solitary mammals 
      and provides a basis for the optimization of managing this species.

TI  - Estrogen Mediates the Sexual Dimorphism of GT1b-Induced Central Pain 
      Sensitization.
LID - 10.3390/cells12050808 [doi]
LID - 808
AB  - We have previously reported that the intrathecal (i.t.) administration of GT1b, a 
      ganglioside, induces spinal cord microglia activation and central pain 
      sensitization as an endogenous agonist of Toll-like receptor 2 on microglia. In 
      this study, we investigated the sexual dimorphism of GT1b-induced central pain 
      sensitization and the underlying mechanisms. GT1b administration induced central 
      pain sensitization only in male but not in female mice. Spinal tissue 
      transcriptomic comparison between male and female mice after GT1b injection 
      suggested the putative involvement of estrogen (E2)-mediated signaling in the 
      sexual dimorphism of GT1b-induced pain sensitization. Upon ovariectomy-reducing 
      systemic E2, female mice became susceptible to GT1b-induced central pain 
      sensitization, which was completely reversed by systemic E2 supplementation. 
      Meanwhile, orchiectomy of male mice did not affect pain sensitization. As an 
      underlying mechanism, we present evidence that E2 inhibits GT1b-induced 
      inflammasome activation and subsequent IL-1β production. Our findings demonstrate 
      that E2 is responsible for sexual dimorphism in GT1b-induced central pain 
      sensitization.

TI  - A complex role of Arabidopsis CDKD;3 in meiotic progression and cytokinesis.

AB  - Meiosis is a specialized cell division that halves the number of chromosomes in 
      two consecutive rounds of chromosome segregation. In angiosperm plants is meiosis 
      followed by mitotic divisions to form rudimentary haploid gametophytes. In 
      Arabidopsis, termination of meiosis and transition to gametophytic development 
      are governed by TDM1 and SMG7 that mediate inhibition of translation. Mutants 
      deficient in this mechanism do not form tetrads but instead undergo multiple 
      cycles of aberrant nuclear divisions that are likely caused by the failure to 
      downregulate cyclin dependent kinases during meiotic exit. A suppressor screen to 
      identify genes that contribute to meiotic exit uncovered a mutation 
      in cyclin-dependent kinase D;3 (CDKD;3) that alleviates meiotic defects in smg7 
      deficient plants. The CDKD;3 deficiency prevents aberrant meiotic divisions 
      observed in smg7 mutants or delays their onset after initiation of cytokinesis, 
      which permits formation of functional microspores. Although CDKD;3 acts as an 
      activator of cyclin-dependent kinase A;1 (CDKA;1), the main cyclin dependent 
      kinase that regulates meiosis, cdkd;3 mutation appears to promote meiotic exit 
      independently of CDKA;1. Furthermore, analysis of CDKD;3 interactome revealed 
      enrichment for proteins implicated in cytokinesis, suggesting a more complex 
      function of CDKD;3 in cell cycle regulation.

TI  - Dynamic analysis of gene signatures in the progression of COPD.
LID - 00343-2022 [pii]

AB  - AIMS: Oxidative stress is an important amplifying mechanism in COPD; however, it 
      is unclear how oxidative stress changes and what its exact amplification 
      mechanism is in the pathological process. We aimed to dynamically analyse the 
      progression of COPD and further elucidate the characteristics of each 
      developmental stage and unveil the underlying mechanisms. METHODS: We performed a 
      holistic analysis by integrating Gene Expression Omnibus microarray datasets 
      related to smoking, emphysema and Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung 
      Disease (GOLD) classification based on the concept of gene, environment and time 
      (GET). Gene ontology (GO), protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks and gene 
      set enrichment analysis (GSEA) were used to explore the changing characteristics 
      and potential mechanisms. Lentivirus was used to promote HIF3A overexpression. 
      RESULTS: In smokers versus nonsmokers, the GO term mainly enriched in "negative 
      regulation of apoptotic process". In later transitions between stages, the main 
      enriched terms were continuous progression of "oxidation-reduction process" and 
      "cellular response to hydrogen peroxide". Logistic regression showed that these 
      core differentially expressed genes (DEGs) had diagnostic accuracy in test (area 
      under the curve (AUC)=0.828) and validation (AUC=0.750) sets. GSEA and PPI 
      networks showed that one of the core DEGs, HIF3A, strongly interacted with the 
      ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis pathway. Overexpression of HIF3A restored 
      superoxide dismutase levels and alleviated the reactive oxygen species 
      accumulation caused by cigarette smoke extract treatment. CONCLUSION: Oxidative 
      stress was continuously intensified from mild emphysema to GOLD 4; thus, special 
      attention should be paid to the identification of emphysema. Furthermore, the 
      downregulated HIF3A may play an important role in the intensified oxidative 
      stress in COPD.

AB  - The prion-like domain (PrLD) is a class of intrinsically disordered regions. 
      Although its propensity to form condensates has been studied in the context of 
      neurodegenerative diseases, the physiological role of PrLD remains unclear. Here, 
      we investigated the role of PrLD in the RNA-binding protein NFAR2, generated by a 
      splicing variant of the Ilf3 gene. Removal of the PrLD in mice did not impair the 
      function of NFAR2 required for survival, but did affect the responses to chronic 
      water immersion and restraint stress (WIRS). The PrLD was required for 
      WIRS-sensitive nuclear localization of NFAR2 and WIRS-induced changes in mRNA 
      expression and translation in the amygdala, a fear-related brain region. 
      Consistently, the PrLD conferred resistance to WIRS in fear-associated memory 
      formation. Our study provides insights into the PrLD-dependent role of NFAR2 for 
      chronic stress adaptation in the brain.

      turmeric. It was found that curcumin has good anti-cancer properties in a variety 
      of cancers, but the exact mechanism is not clear. Based on the network 
      pharmacology and molecular docking to deeply investigate the molecular mechanism 
      of curcumin for the treatment of colon cancer, it provides a new research 
      direction for the treatment of colon cancer. Methods: Curcumin-related targets 
      were collected using PharmMapper, SwissTargetPrediction, Targetnet and SuperPred. 
      Colon cancer related targets were obtained using OMIM, DisGeNET, GeneCards and 
      GEO databases. Drug-disease intersection targets were obtained via Venny 2.1.0. 
      GO and KEGG enrichment analysis of drug-disease common targets were performed 
      using DAVID. Construct PPI network graphs of intersecting targets using STRING 
      database as well as Cytoscape 3.9.0 and filter core targets. Molecular docking 
      via AutoDockTools 1.5.7. The core targets were further analyzed by GEPIA, HPA, 
      cBioPortal and TIMER databases. Results: A total of 73 potential targets of 
      curcumin for the treatment of colon cancer were obtained. GO function enrichment 
      analysis yielded 256 entries, including BP(Biological Progress):166, CC(celluar 
      component):36 and MF(Molecular Function):54. The KEGG pathway enrichment analysis 
      yielded 34 signaling pathways, mainly involved in Metabolic pathways, Nucleotide 
      metabolism, Nitrogen metabolism, Drug metabolism - other enzymes, Pathways in 
      cancer,PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, etc. CDK2, HSP90AA1, AURKB, CCNA2, TYMS, 
      CHEK1, AURKA, DNMT1, TOP2A, and TK1 were identified as core targets by Cytoscape 
      3.9.0. Molecular docking results showed that the binding energies of curcumin to 
      the core targets were all less than 0 kJ-mol-1, suggesting that curcumin binds 
      spontaneously to the core targets. These results were further validated in terms 
      of mRNA expression levels, protein expression levels and immune infiltration. 
      Conclusion: Based on network pharmacology and molecular docking initially 
      revealed that curcumin exerts its therapeutic effects on colon cancer with 
      multi-target, multi-pathway. Curcumin may exert anticancer effects by binding to 
      core targets. Curcumin may interfere with colon cancer cell proliferation and 
      apoptosis by regulating signal transduction pathways such as PI3K-Akt signaling 
      pathway,IL-17 signaling pathway, Cell cycle. This will deepen and enrich our 
      understanding of the potential mechanism of curcumin against colon cancer and 
      provide a theoretical basis for subsequent studies.

AB  - Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) plays an important role in large-scale data 
      analysis, helping scientists discover the underlying biological patterns 
      over-represented in a gene list resulting from, for example, an 'omics' study. 
      Gene Ontology (GO) annotation is the most frequently used classification 
      mechanism for gene set definition. Here we present a new GSEA tool, PANGEA 
      (PAthway, Network and Gene-set Enrichment Analysis; 
      https://www.flyrnai.org/tools/pangea/ ), developed to allow a more flexible and 
      configurable approach to data analysis using a variety of classification sets. 
      PANGEA allows GO analysis to be performed on different sets of GO annotations, 
      for example excluding high-throughput studies. Beyond GO, gene sets for pathway 
      annotation and protein complex data from various resources as well as expression 
      and disease annotation from the Alliance of Genome Resources (Alliance). In 
      addition, visualisations of results are enhanced by providing an option to view 
      network of gene set to gene relationships. The tool also allows comparison of 
      multiple input gene lists and accompanying visualisation tools for quick and easy 
      comparison. This new tool will facilitate GSEA for Drosophila and other major 
      model organisms based on high-quality annotated information available for these 
      species.

TI  - BACH1 deficiency prevents neointima formation and maintains the differentiated 
      phenotype of vascular smooth muscle cells by regulating chromatin accessibility.
PG  - 4284-4301
LID - 10.1093/nar/gkad120 [doi]
AB  - The transcription factor BTB and CNC homology 1(BACH1) has been linked to 
      coronary artery disease risk by human genome-wide association studies, but little 
      is known about the role of BACH1 in vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) phenotype 
      switching and neointima formation following vascular injury. Therefore, this 
      study aims to explore the role of BACH1 in vascular remodeling and its underlying 
      mechanisms. BACH1 was highly expressed in human atherosclerotic plaques and has 
      high transcriptional factor activity in VSMCs of human atherosclerotic arteries. 
      VSMC-specific loss of Bach1 in mice inhibited the transformation of VSMC from 
      contractile to synthetic phenotype and VSMC proliferation and attenuated the 
      neointimal hyperplasia induced by wire injury. Mechanistically, BACH1 suppressed 
      chromatin accessibility at the promoters of VSMC marker genes via recruiting 
      histone methyltransferase G9a and cofactor YAP and maintaining the H3K9me2 state, 
      thereby repressing VSMC marker genes expression in human aortic smooth muscle 
      cells (HASMCs). BACH1-induced repression of VSMC marker genes was abolished by 
      the silencing of G9a or YAP. Thus, these findings demonstrate a crucial 
      regulatory role of BACH1 in VSMC phenotypic transition and vascular homeostasis 
      and shed light on potential future protective vascular disease intervention via 
      manipulation of BACH1.

TI  - Positive allosteric GABA(A) receptor modulation counteracts lipotoxicity-induced 
      gene expression changes in hepatocytes in vitro.
PG  - 1106075
LID - 10.3389/fphys.2023.1106075 [doi]
LID - 1106075
AB  - Introduction: We have previously shown that the novel positive allosteric 
      modulator of the GABA(A) receptor, HK4, exerts hepatoprotective effects against 
      lipotoxicity-induced apoptosis, DNA damage, inflammation and ER stress in vitro. 
      This might be mediated by downregulated phosphorylation of the transcription 
      factors NF-κB and STAT3. The current study aimed to investigate the effect of HK4 
      on lipotoxicity-induced hepatocyte injury at the transcriptional level. Methods: 
      HepG2 cells were treated with palmitate (200 μM) in the presence or absence of 
      HK4 (10 μM) for 7 h. Total RNA was isolated and the expression profiles of mRNAs 
      were assessed. Differentially expressed genes were identified and subjected to 
      the DAVID database and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software for functional and 
      pathway analysis, all under appropriate statistical testing. Results: 
      Transcriptomic analysis showed substantial modifications in gene expression in 
      response to palmitate as lipotoxic stimulus with 1,457 differentially expressed 
      genes affecting lipid metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation, apoptosis, oxidative 
      and ER stress among others. HK4 preincubation resulted in the prevention of 
      palmitate-induced dysregulation by restoring initial gene expression pattern of 
      untreated hepatocytes comprising 456 genes. Out of the 456 genes, 342 genes were 
      upregulated and 114 downregulated by HK4. Enriched pathways analysis of those 
      genes by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis, pointed towards oxidative phosphorylation, 
      mitochondrial dysregulation, protein ubiquitination, apoptosis, and cell cycle 
      regulation as affected pathways. These pathways are regulated by the key upstream 
      regulators TP53, KDM5B, DDX5, CAB39 L and SYVN1, which orchestrate the metabolic 
      and oxidative stress responses including modulation of DNA repair and degradation 
      of ER stress-induced misfolded proteins in the presence or absence of HK4. 
      Discussion: We conclude that HK4 specifically targets mitochondrial respiration, 
      protein ubiquitination, apoptosis and cell cycle. This not only helps to 
      counteract lipotoxic hepatocellular injury through modification of gene 
      expression, but - by targeting transcription factors responsible for DNA repair, 
      cell cycle progression and ER stress - might even prevent lipotoxic mechanisms. 
      These findings suggest that HK4 has a great potential for the treatment of 
      non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).

TI  - Identification of alternative splicing events related to fatty liver formation in 
      duck using full-length transcripts.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is one of most common 
      diseases in the world. Recently, alternative splicing (AS) has been reported to 
      play a key role in NAFLD processes in mammals. Ducks can quickly form fatty liver 
      similar to human NAFLD after overfeeding and restore to normal liver in a short 
      time, suggesting that ducks are an excellent model to unravel molecular 
      mechanisms of lipid metabolism for NAFLD. However, how alternative splicing 
      events (ASEs) affect the fatty liver process in ducks is still unclear. RESULTS: 
      Here we identify 126,277 unique transcripts in liver tissue from an overfed duck 
      (77,237 total transcripts) and its sibling control (69,618 total transcripts). We 
      combined these full-length transcripts with Illumina RNA-seq data from five pairs 
      of overfed ducks and control individuals. Full-length transcript sequencing 
      provided us with structural information of transcripts and Illumina RNA-seq data 
      reveals the expressional profile of each transcript. We found, among these unique 
      transcripts, 30,618 were lncRNAs and 1,744 transcripts including 155 lncRNAs and 
      1,589 coding transcripts showed significantly differential expression in liver 
      tissues between overfed ducks and control individuals. We also detected 27,317 
      ASEs and 142 of them showed significant relative abundance changes in ducks under 
      different feeding conditions. Full-length transcript profiles together with 
      Illumina RNA-seq data demonstrated that 10 genes involving in lipid metabolism 
      had ASEs with significantly differential abundance in normally fed (control) and 
      overfed ducks. Among these genes, protein products of five genes (CYP4F22, BTN, 
      GSTA2, ADH5, and DHRS2 genes) were changed by ASEs. CONCLUSIONS: This study 
      presents an example of how to identify ASEs related to important biological 
      processes, such as fatty liver formation, using full-length transcripts alongside 
      Illumina RNA-seq data. Based on these data, we screened out ASEs of 
      lipid-metabolism related genes which might respond to overfeeding. Our future 
      ability to explore the function of genes showing AS differences between overfed 
      ducks and their sibling controls, using genetic manipulations and co-evolutionary 
      studies, will certainly extend our knowledge of genes related to the 
      non-pathogenic fatty liver process.

TI  - A New Phenotype in Candida-Epithelial Cell Interaction Distinguishes 
      Colonization- versus Vulvovaginal Candidiasis-Associated Strains.
PG  - e0010723
LID - 10.1128/mbio.00107-23 [doi]
LID - e00107-23
AB  - Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) affects nearly 3/4 of women during their lifetime, 
      and its symptoms seriously reduce quality of life. Although Candida albicans is a 
      common commensal, it is unknown if VVC results from a switch from a commensal to 
      pathogenic state, if only some strains can cause VVC, and/or if there is 
      displacement of commensal strains with more pathogenic strains. We studied a set 
      of VVC and colonizing C. albicans strains to identify consistent in vitro 
      phenotypes associated with one group or the other. We find that the strains do 
      not differ in overall genetic profile or behavior in culture media (i.e., 
      multilocus sequence type [MLST] profile, rate of growth, and filamentation), but 
      they show strikingly different behaviors during their interactions with vaginal 
      epithelial cells. Epithelial infections with VVC-derived strains yielded stronger 
      fungal proliferation and shedding of fungi and epithelial cells. Transcriptome 
      sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of representative epithelial cell infections with 
      selected pathogenic or commensal isolates identified several differentially 
      activated epithelial signaling pathways, including the integrin, ferroptosis, and 
      type I interferon pathways; the latter has been implicated in damage protection. 
      Strikingly, inhibition of type I interferon signaling selectively increases 
      fungal shedding of strains in the colonizing cohort, suggesting that increased 
      shedding correlates with lower interferon pathway activation. These data suggest 
      that VVC strains may intrinsically have enhanced pathogenic potential via 
      differential elicitation of epithelial responses, including the type I interferon 
      pathway. Therefore, it may eventually be possible to evaluate pathogenic 
      potential in vitro to refine VVC diagnosis. IMPORTANCE Despite a high incidence 
      of VVC, we still have a poor understanding of this female-specific disease whose 
      negative impact on women's quality of life has become a public health issue. It 
      is not yet possible to determine by genotype or laboratory phenotype if a given 
      Candida albicans strain is more or less likely to cause VVC. Here, we show that 
      Candida strains causing VVC induce more fungal shedding from epithelial cells 
      than strains from healthy women. This effect is also accompanied by increased 
      epithelial cell detachment and differential activation of the type I interferon 
      pathway. These distinguishing phenotypes suggest it may be possible to evaluate 
      the VVC pathogenic potential of fungal isolates. This would permit more targeted 
      antifungal treatments to spare commensals and could allow for displacement of 
      pathogenic strains with nonpathogenic colonizers. We expect these new assays to 
      provide a more targeted tool for identifying fungal virulence factors and 
      epithelial responses that control fungal vaginitis.

AB  - Radial glial cells (RGCs) are essential for the generation and organization of 
      neurons in the cerebral cortex. RGCs have an elongated bipolar morphology with 
      basal and apical endfeet that reside in distinct niches. Yet, how this 
      subcellular compartmentalization of RGCs controls cortical development is largely 
      unknown. Here, we employ in vivo proximity labeling, in the mouse, using unfused 
      BirA to generate the first subcellular proteome of RGCs and uncover new 
      principles governing local control of cortical development. We discover a cohort 
      of proteins that are significantly enriched in RGC basal endfeet, with MYH9 and 
      MYH10 among the most abundant. Myh9 and Myh10 transcripts also localize to 
      endfeet with distinct temporal dynamics. Although they each encode isoforms of 
      non-muscle myosin II heavy chain, Myh9 and Myh10 have drastically different 
      requirements for RGC integrity. Myh9 loss from RGCs decreases branching 
      complexity and causes endfoot protrusion through the basement membrane. In 
      contrast, Myh10 controls endfoot adhesion, as mutants have unattached apical and 
      basal endfeet. Finally, we show that Myh9- and Myh10-mediated regulation of RGC 
      complexity and endfoot position non-cell autonomously controls interneuron number 
      and organization in the marginal zone. Our study demonstrates the utility of in 
      vivo proximity labeling for dissecting local control of complex systems and 
      reveals new mechanisms for dictating RGC integrity and cortical architecture.

AB  - The approved gene therapies for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), caused by loss of 
      survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1), greatly ameliorate SMA natural history but are 
      not curative. These therapies primarily target motor neurons, but SMN1 loss has 
      detrimental effects beyond motor neurons and especially in muscle. Here we show 
      that SMN loss in mouse skeletal muscle leads to accumulation of dysfunctional 
      mitochondria. Expression profiling of single myofibers from a muscle specific 
      Smn1 knockout mouse model revealed down-regulation of mitochondrial and lysosomal 
      genes. Albeit levels of proteins that mark mitochondria for mitophagy were 
      increased, morphologically deranged mitochondria with impaired complex I and IV 
      activity and respiration and that produced excess reactive oxygen species 
      accumulated in Smn1 knockout muscles, because of the lysosomal dysfunction 
      highlighted by the transcriptional profiling. Amniotic fluid stem cells 
      transplantation that corrects the SMN knockout mouse myopathic phenotype restored 
      mitochondrial morphology and expression of mitochondrial genes. Thus, targeting 
      muscle mitochondrial dysfunction in SMA may complement the current gene therapy.

AB  - Cytosine methylation is an epigenetic mark that participates in regulation of 
      gene expression and chromatin stability in plants. Advancements in whole genome 
      sequencing technologies have enabled investigation of methylome dynamics under 
      different conditions. However, the computational methods for analyzing bisulfite 
      sequence data have not been unified. Contention remains in the correlation of 
      differentially methylated positions with the investigated treatment and exclusion 
      of noise, inherent to these stochastic datasets. The prevalent approaches apply 
      Fisher's exact test, logistic, or beta regression, followed by an arbitrary 
      cut-off for differences in methylation levels. A different strategy, the MethylIT 
      pipeline, utilizes signal detection to determine cut-off based on a fitted 
      generalized gamma probability distribution of methylation divergence. Re-analysis 
      of publicly available BS-seq data from two epigenetic studies in Arabidopsis and 
      applying MethylIT revealed additional, previously unreported results. Methylome 
      repatterning in response to phosphate starvation was confirmed to be 
      tissue-specific and included phosphate assimilation genes in addition to sulfate 
      metabolism genes not implicated in the original study. During seed germination 
      plants undergo major methylome reprogramming and use of MethylIT allowed us to 
      identify stage-specific gene networks. We surmise from these comparative studies 
      that robust methylome experiments must account for data stochasticity to achieve 
      meaningful functional analyses.

TI  - Foxm1 regulates cardiomyocyte proliferation in adult zebrafish after cardiac 
      injury.
LID - 10.1242/dev.201163 [doi]
LID - dev201163
AB  - The regenerative capacity of the mammalian heart is poor, with one potential 
      reason being that adult cardiomyocytes cannot proliferate at sufficient levels to 
      replace lost tissue. During development and neonatal stages, cardiomyocytes can 
      successfully divide under injury conditions; however, as these cells mature their 
      ability to proliferate is lost. Therefore, understanding the regulatory programs 
      that can induce post-mitotic cardiomyocytes into a proliferative state is 
      essential to enhance cardiac regeneration. Here, we report that the forkhead 
      transcription factor Foxm1 is required for cardiomyocyte proliferation after 
      injury through transcriptional regulation of cell cycle genes. Transcriptomic 
      analysis of injured zebrafish hearts revealed that foxm1 expression is increased 
      in border zone cardiomyocytes. Decreased cardiomyocyte proliferation and 
      expression of cell cycle genes in foxm1 mutant hearts was observed, suggesting it 
      is required for cell cycle checkpoints. Subsequent analysis of a candidate Foxm1 
      target gene, cenpf, revealed that this microtubule and kinetochore binding 
      protein is also required for cardiac regeneration. Moreover, cenpf mutants show 
      increased cardiomyocyte binucleation. Thus, foxm1 and cenpf are required for 
      cardiomyocytes to complete mitosis during zebrafish cardiac regeneration.

AB  - Purpose: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common degenerative disease, which still lacks 
      specific therapeutic drugs. Synovitis is one of the most important pathological 
      process in OA. Therefore, we aim to identify and analyze the hub genes and their 
      related networks of OA synovium with bioinformatics tools to provide theoretical 
      basis for potential drugs. Materials and methods: Two datasets were obtained from 
      GEO. DEGs and hub genes of OA synovial tissue were screened through Gene Ontology 
      (GO) annotation, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway 
      enrichment as well as protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis. 
      Subsequently, the correlation between expression of hub genes and ferroptosis or 
      pyroptosis was analyzed. CeRNA regulatory network was constructed after 
      predicting the upstream miRNAs and lncRNAs. The validation of hub genes was 
      undertook through RT-qPCR and ELISA. Finally, potential drugs targeting pathways 
      and hub genes were identified, followed by the validation of the effect of two 
      potential drugs on OA. Results: A total of 161 commom DEGs were obtained, of 
      which 8 genes were finally identified as hub genes through GO and KEGG enrichment 
      analysis as well as PPI network analysis. Eight genes related to ferroptosis and 
      pyroptosis respectively were significantly correlated to the expression of hub 
      genes. 24 miRNAs and 69 lncRNAs were identified to construct the ceRNA regulatory 
      network. The validation of EGR1, JUN, MYC, FOSL1, and FOSL2 met the trend of 
      bioinformatics analysis. Etanercept and Iguratimod reduced the secretion of 
      MMP-13 and ADAMTS5 of fibroblast-like synoviocyte. Conclusion: EGR1, JUN, MYC, 
      FOSL1, and FOSL2 were identified as hub genes in the development of OA after 
      series of bioinformatics analysis and validation. Etanercept and Iguratimod 
      seemed to have opportunities to be novel drugs for OA.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The neural control of the immune system by the nervous system is 
      critical to maintaining immune homeostasis, whose disruption may be an underlying 
      cause of several diseases, including cancer, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid 
      arthritis, and Alzheimer's disease. METHODS: Here we studied the role of vagus 
      nerve stimulation (VNS) on gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells 
      (PBMCs). Vagus nerve stimulation is widely used as an alternative treatment for 
      drug-resistant epilepsy. Thus, we studied the impact that VNS treatment has on 
      PBMCs isolated from a cohort of existing patients with medically refractory 
      epilepsy. A comparison of genome-wide changes in gene expression was made between 
      the epilepsy patients treated and non-treated with vagus nerve stimulation. 
      RESULTS: The analysis showed downregulation of genes related to stress, 
      inflammatory response, and immunity, suggesting an anti-inflammatory effect of 
      VNS in epilepsy patients. VNS also resulted in the downregulation of the insulin 
      catabolic process, which may reduce circulating blood glucose. DISCUSSION: These 
      results provide a potential molecular explanation for the beneficial role of the 
      ketogenic diet, which also controls blood glucose, in treating refractory 
      epilepsy. The findings indicate that direct VNS might be a useful therapeutic 
      alternative to treat chronic inflammatory conditions.

      Liver Injury in Mice.

AB  - Activation of Kupffer cells (KCs) by gut-derived lipopolysaccharide (LPS) 
      instigates nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)-mediated inflammatory responses in 
      alcohol-associated liver diseases (ALD). Here, we utilized a novel 
      optogenetically engineered exosome technology called 'exosomes for protein 
      loading via optically reversible protein-protein interactions (EXPLOR)' to 
      efficiently deliver the super-repressor IκB-loaded exosomes (Exo-srIκB) to the 
      liver and examined its therapeutic potential in acute-on-chronic 
      alcohol-associated liver injury. We detected enhanced uptake of DiI-labeled 
      Exo-srIκB by LPS-treated inflammatory KCs, which suppressed LPS-induced 
      inflammatory gene expression levels. In animal experiments, a single intravenous 
      injection of Exo-srIκB prior to alcohol binge drinking significantly attenuated 
      alcohol-associated hepatic steatosis and infiltration of neutrophils and 
      macrophages but not a liver injury. Notably, three consecutive days of Exo-srIκB 
      injection remarkably reduced alcohol-associated liver injury, steatosis, 
      apoptosis of hepatocytes, fibrosis-related gene expression levels in hepatic 
      stellate cells, infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages, and inflammatory 
      gene expression levels in hepatocytes and KCs. In particular, the above effects 
      occurred with inhibition of nuclear translocation of NF-κB in liver tissues, and 
      these beneficial effects of Exo-srIκB on ALD were shown regardless of doses. Our 
      results suggest an exosome-based modulation of NF-κB activity in KCs by Exo-srIκB 
      as a novel and efficient therapeutic approach in ALD.

TI  - Investigation of the Pathogenic Mechanism of Ciprofloxacin in Aortic Aneurysm and 
      Dissection by an Integrated Proteomics and Network Pharmacology Strategy.
LID - 10.3390/jcm12041270 [doi]
LID - 1270
AB  - Aortic aneurysm and dissection (AAD) is a life-threatening disease worldwide. 
      Recently, fluoroquinolones have been reported to significantly increase the risk 
      of AAD. This study aimed to investigate the potential functional mechanism and 
      molecular targets of fluoroquinolones in relation to AAD by an integrated 
      proteomic and network pharmacology strategy. A total of 1351 differentially 
      expressed proteins were identified in human aortic vascular smooth muscle cells 
      (VSMCs) after ciprofloxacin (CIP) stimulation. The functional analysis emphasized 
      the important roles of metabolism, extracellular matrix homeostasis, 
      mitochondrial damage, focal adhesion, and apoptosis in CIP-stimulated VSMCs. CIP 
      targets were predicted with online databases and verified by molecular docking. 
      Protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis and module construction of the 34 
      potential CIP targets and 37 selected hub molecules after CIP stimulation 
      identified four critical target proteins in the module: PARP1, RAC1, IGF1R and 
      MKI67. Functional analysis of the PPI module showed that the MAPK signalling 
      pathway, focal adhesion, apoptosis, regulation of actin cytoskeleton, and 
      PI3K-Akt signalling pathway were significantly enriched. Our results will provide 
      novel insights into the pathogenic mechanism of fluoroquinolones in aortic 
      diseases.

TI  - Metabolic Background, Not Photosynthetic Physiology, Determines Drought and 
      Drought Recovery Responses in C3 and C2 Moricandias.
LID - 10.3390/ijms24044094 [doi]
LID - 4094
AB  - Distinct photosynthetic physiologies are found within the Moricandia genus, both 
      C3-type and C2-type representatives being known. As C2-physiology is an 
      adaptation to drier environments, a study of physiology, biochemistry and 
      transcriptomics was conducted to investigate whether plants with C2-physiology 
      are more tolerant of low water availability and recover better from drought. Our 
      data on Moricandia moricandioides (Mmo, C3), M. arvensis (Mav, C2) and M. 
      suffruticosa (Msu, C2) show that C3 and C2-type Moricandias are metabolically 
      distinct under all conditions tested (well-watered, severe drought, early drought 
      recovery). Photosynthetic activity was found to be largely dependent upon the 
      stomatal opening. The C2-type M. arvensis was able to secure 25-50% of 
      photosynthesis under severe drought as compared to the C3-type M. moricandioides. 
      Nevertheless, the C2-physiology does not seem to play a central role in M. 
      arvensis drought responses and drought recovery. Instead, our biochemical data 
      indicated metabolic differences in carbon and redox-related metabolism under the 
      examined conditions. The cell wall dynamics and glucosinolate metabolism 
      regulations were found to be major discriminators between M. arvensis and M. 
      moricandioides at the transcription level.

AB  - The phenotypic and genetic links between body fat phenotypes and primary 
      open-angle glaucoma (POAG) are unclear. We conducted a meta-analysis of relevant 
      longitudinal epidemiological studies to evaluate the phenotypic link. To identify 
      genetic links, we performed genetic correlation analysis and pleiotropy analysis 
      of genome-wide association study summary statistics datasets of POAG, intraocular 
      pressure (IOP), vertical cup-to-disc ratio, obesity, body mass index (BMI), and 
      waist-to-hip ratio. In the meta-analysis, we first established that obese and 
      underweight populations have a significantly higher risk of POAG using 
      longitudinal data. We also discovered positive genetic correlations between POAG 
      and BMI and obesity phenotypes. Finally, we identified over 20 genomic loci 
      jointly associated with POAG/IOP and BMI. Among them, the genes loci CADM2, 
      RP3-335N17.2, RP11-793K1.1, RPS17P5, and CASC20 showed the lowest false discovery 
      rate. These findings support the connection between body fat phenotypes and POAG. 
      The newly identified genomic loci and genes render further functional 
      investigation.

TI  - Mechanical Ventilation-Related High Stretch Mainly Induces Endoplasmic Reticulum 
      Stress and Thus Mediates Inflammation Response in Cultured Human Primary Airway 
      Smooth Muscle Cells.

AB  - Ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) occurs in mechanically ventilated patients 
      of respiratory disease and is typically characterized by airway inflammation. 
      However, recent studies increasingly indicate that a major cause of VILI may be 
      the excessive mechanical loading such as high stretch (>10% strain) on airway 
      smooth muscle cells (ASMCs) due to mechanical ventilation (MV). Although ASMCs 
      are the primary mechanosensitive cells in airways and contribute to various 
      airway inflammation diseases, it is still unclear how they respond to high 
      stretch and what mediates such a response. Therefore, we used whole genome-wide 
      mRNA-sequencing (mRNA-Seq), bioinformatics, and functional identification to 
      systematically analyze the mRNA expression profiles and signaling pathway 
      enrichment of cultured human ASMCs exposed to high stretch (13% strain), aiming 
      to screen the susceptible signaling pathway through which cells respond to high 
      stretch. The data revealed that in response to high stretch, 111 mRNAs with count 
      ≥100 in ASMCs were significantly differentially expressed (defined as DE-mRNAs). 
      These DE-mRNAs are mainly enriched in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-related 
      signaling pathways. ER stress inhibitor (TUDCA) abolished high-stretch-enhanced 
      mRNA expression of genes associated with ER stress, downstream inflammation 
      signaling, and major inflammatory cytokines. These results demonstrate in a 
      data-driven approach that in ASMCs, high stretch mainly induced ER stress and 
      activated ER stress-related signaling and downstream inflammation response. 
      Therefore, it suggests that ER stress and related signaling pathways in ASMCs may 
      be potential targets for timely diagnosis and intervention of MV-related 
      pulmonary airway diseases such as VILI.

TI  - Differential Expression of MED12-Associated Coding RNA Transcripts in Uterine 
      Leiomyomas.
LID - 10.3390/ijms24043742 [doi]
LID - 3742
AB  - Recent studies have demonstrated that somatic MED12 mutations in exon 2 occur at 
      a frequency of up to 80% and have a functional role in leiomyoma pathogenesis. 
      The objective of this study was to elucidate the expression profile of coding RNA 
      transcripts in leiomyomas, with and without these mutations, and their paired 
      myometrium. Next-generation RNA sequencing (NGS) was used to systematically 
      profile the differentially expressed RNA transcripts from paired leiomyomas (n = 
      19). The differential analysis indicated there are 394 genes differentially and 
      aberrantly expressed only in the mutated tumors. These genes were predominantly 
      involved in the regulation of extracellular constituents. Of the differentially 
      expressed genes that overlapped in the two comparison groups, the magnitude of 
      change in gene expression was greater for many genes in tumors bearing MED12 
      mutations. Although the myometrium did not express MED12 mutations, there were 
      marked differences in the transcriptome landscape of the myometrium from mutated 
      and non-mutated specimens, with genes regulating the response to 
      oxygen-containing compounds being most altered. In conclusion, MED12 mutations 
      have profound effects on the expression of genes pivotal to leiomyoma 
      pathogenesis in the tumor and the myometrium which could alter tumor 
      characteristics and growth potential.

TI  - Proximity Labeling to Identify β-Arrestin1 Binding Partners Downstream of 
      Ligand-Activated G Protein-Coupled Receptors.
LID - 10.3390/ijms24043285 [doi]
LID - 3285
AB  - β-arrestins are multifaceted adaptor proteins that regulate various aspects of G 
      protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling. β-arrestins are recruited to 
      agonist-activated and phosphorylated GPCRs at the plasma membrane, thereby 
      preventing G protein coupling, while also targeting GPCRs for internalization via 
      clathrin-coated pits. In addition, β-arrestins can activate various effector 
      molecules to prosecute their role in GPCR signaling; however, the full extent of 
      their interacting partners remains unknown. To discover potentially novel 
      β-arrestin interacting partners, we used APEX-based proximity labeling coupled 
      with affinity purification and quantitative mass spectrometry. We appended APEX 
      in-frame to the C-terminus of β-arrestin1 (βarr1-APEX), which we show does not 
      impact its ability to support agonist-stimulated internalization of GPCRs. By 
      using coimmunoprecipitation, we show that βarr1-APEX interacts with known 
      interacting proteins. Furthermore, following agonist stimulation βarr1-APEX 
      labeled known βarr1-interacting partners as assessed by streptavidin affinity 
      purification and immunoblotting. Aliquots were prepared in a similar manner and 
      analyzed by tandem mass tag labeling and high-content quantitative mass 
      spectrometry. Several proteins were found to be increased in abundance following 
      GPCR stimulation. Biochemical experiments confirmed two novel proteins that 
      interact with β-arrestin1, which we predict are novel ligand-stimulated βarr1 
      interacting partners. Our study highlights that βarr1-APEX-based proximity 
      labeling represents a valuable approach to identifying novel players involved in 
      GPCR signaling.

TI  - Quantitative Proteomics of Human Retinal Pigment Epithelium Reveals Key 
      Regulators for the Pathogenesis of Age-Related Macular Degeneration.
LID - 10.3390/ijms24043252 [doi]
LID - 3252
AB  - Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of blindness in 
      elderly people, with limited treatment options available for most patients. AMD 
      involves the death of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and photoreceptor cells, 
      with mitochondria dysfunction being a critical early event. In the current study, 
      we utilized our unique resource of human donor RPE graded for AMD presence and 
      severity to investigate proteome-wide dysregulation involved in early AMD. 
      Organelle-enriched fractions of RPE were isolated from donors with early AMD (n = 
      45) and healthy age-matched controls (n = 32) and were analyzed by UHR-IonStar, 
      an integrated proteomics platform enabling reliable and in-depth proteomic 
      quantification in large cohorts. A total of 5941 proteins were quantified with 
      excellent analytical reproducibility, and with further informatics analysis, many 
      biological functions and pathways were found to be significantly dysregulated in 
      donor RPE samples with early AMD. Several of these directly pinpointed changes in 
      mitochondrial functions, e.g., translation, ATP metabolic process, lipid 
      homeostasis, and oxidative stress. These novel findings highlighted the value of 
      our proteomics investigation by allowing a better understanding of the molecular 
      mechanisms underlying early AMD onset and facilitating both treatment development 
      and biomarker discovery.

AB  - Sperm heterogeneity creates challenges for successful artificial insemination. 
      Seminal plasma (SP) surrounding sperm is an excellent source for detecting 
      reliable non-invasive biomarkers of sperm quality. Here, we isolated microRNAs 
      (miRNAs) from SP-derived extracellular vesicles (SP-EV) of boars with divergent 
      sperm quality statuses. Raw semen from sexually mature boars was collected for 
      eight weeks. Sperm motility and normal morphology were analyzed, and the sperm 
      was classified as poor- or good-quality based on standard cutoffs of 70% for the 
      parameters measured. SP-EVs were isolated by ultracentrifugation and confirmed by 
      electron microscopy, dynamic light scattering, and Western immunoblotting. The 
      SP-EVs were subjected to total exosome RNA isolation, miRNA sequencing, and 
      bioinformatics analysis. The isolated SP-EVs were round spherical structures 
      approximately 30-400 nm in diameter expressing specific molecular markers. miRNAs 
      were detected in both poor- (n = 281) and good (n = 271)-quality sperm, with 
      fifteen being differentially expressed. Only three (ssc-miR-205, ssc-miR-493-5p, 
      and ssc-miR-378b-3p) allowed gene targeting associated with cellular localization 
      (nuclear and cytosol) and molecular functions (acetylation, Ubl conjugation, and 
      protein kinase binding), potentially impairing sperm quality. PTEN and YWHAZ 
      emerged as essential proteins for protein kinase binding. We conclude that 
      SP-EV-derived miRNAs reflect boar sperm quality to enable therapeutic strategies 
      to improve fertility.

TI  - FUS Alters circRNA Metabolism in Human Motor Neurons Carrying the ALS-Linked 
      P525L Mutation.
LID - 10.3390/ijms24043181 [doi]
LID - 3181
AB  - Deregulation of RNA metabolism has emerged as one of the key events leading to 
      the degeneration of motor neurons (MNs) in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) 
      disease. Indeed, mutations on RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) or on proteins involved 
      in aspects of RNA metabolism account for the majority of familiar forms of ALS. 
      In particular, the impact of the ALS-linked mutations of the RBP FUS on many 
      aspects of RNA-related processes has been vastly investigated. FUS plays a 
      pivotal role in splicing regulation and its mutations severely alter the exon 
      composition of transcripts coding for proteins involved in neurogenesis, axon 
      guidance, and synaptic activity. In this study, by using in vitro-derived human 
      MNs, we investigate the effect of the P525L FUS mutation on non-canonical 
      splicing events that leads to the formation of circular RNAs (circRNAs). We 
      observed altered levels of circRNAs in FUS(P525L) MNs and a preferential binding 
      of the mutant protein to introns flanking downregulated circRNAs and containing 
      inverted Alu repeats. For a subset of circRNAs, FUS(P525L) also impacts their 
      nuclear/cytoplasmic partitioning, confirming its involvement in different 
      processes of RNA metabolism. Finally, we assess the potential of cytoplasmic 
      circRNAs to act as miRNA sponges, with possible implications in ALS pathogenesis.

TI  - A Rare Adult Primary Intracranial Sarcoma, DICER1-Mutant Identified by Epigenomic 
      Profiling: A Case Report.
LID - 10.3390/brainsci13020235 [doi]
LID - 235
AB  - Diagnoses of primary malignant mesenchymal brain tumors are a challenge for 
      pathologists. Here, we report the case of a 52-year-old man with a primary brain 
      tumor, histologically diagnosed as a high-grade glioma, not otherwise specified 
      (NOS). The patient underwent two neurosurgeries in several months, followed by 
      radiotherapy and chemotherapy. We re-examined the tumor samples by methylome 
      profiling. Methylome analysis revealed an epi-signature typical of a primary 
      intracranial sarcoma, DICER1-mutant, an extremely rare tumor. The diagnosis was 
      confirmed by DNA sequencing that revealed a mutation in DICER1 exon 25. DICER1 
      mutations were not found in the patient's blood cells, thus excluding an 
      inherited DICER1 syndrome. The methylome profile of the DICER1 mutant sarcoma was 
      then compared with that of a high-grade glioma, a morphologically similar tumor 
      type. We found that several relevant regions were differentially methylated. 
      Taken together, we report the morphological, epigenetic, and genetic 
      characterization of the sixth described case of an adult primary intracranial 
      sarcoma, DICER1-mutant to-date. Furthermore, this case report underscores the 
      importance of methylome analysis to refine primary brain tumor diagnosis and to 
      avoid misdiagnosis among morphologically similar subtypes.

      Space Station.
LID - 10.3390/biom13020371 [doi]
LID - 371
AB  - Efforts to understand the impact of spaceflight on the human body stem from 
      growing interest in long-term space travel. Multiple organ systems are affected 
      by microgravity and radiation, including the cardiovascular system. Previous 
      transcriptomic studies have sought to reveal the changes in gene expression after 
      spaceflight. However, little is known about the impact of long-term spaceflight 
      on the mouse heart in vivo. This study focuses on the transcriptomic changes in 
      the hearts of female C57BL/6J mice flown on the International Space Station (ISS) 
      for 30 days. RNA was isolated from the hearts of three flight and three 
      comparable ground control mice and RNA sequencing was performed. Our analyses 
      showed that 1147 transcripts were significantly regulated after spaceflight. The 
      MAPK, PI3K-Akt, and GPCR signaling pathways were predicted to be activated. 
      Transcripts related to cytoskeleton breakdown and organization were upregulated, 
      but no significant change in the expression of extracellular matrix (ECM) 
      components or oxidative stress pathway-associated transcripts occurred. Our 
      results indicate an absence of cellular senescence, and a significant 
      upregulation of transcripts associated with the cell cycle. Transcripts related 
      to cellular maintenance and survival were most affected by spaceflight, 
      suggesting that cardiovascular transcriptome initiates an adaptive response to 
      long-term spaceflight.

AB  - Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a rare autoimmune bile duct disease that 
      is strongly associated with immune-mediated disorders. In this study, we 
      implemented multitrait joint analyses to genome-wide association summary 
      statistics of PSC and numerous clinical and epidemiological traits to estimate 
      the genetic contribution of each trait and genetic correlations between traits 
      and to identify new lead PSC risk-associated loci. We identified seven new loci 
      that have not been previously reported and one new independent lead variant in 
      the previously reported locus. Functional annotation and fine-mapping nominated 
      several potential susceptibility genes such as MANBA and IRF5. Network-based in 
      silico drug efficacy screening provided candidate agents for further study of 
      pharmacological effect in PSC.

AB  - Modifications of mRNA, especially methylation of adenosine, have recently drawn 
      much attention. The much rarer modification, 5-hydroxymethylation of cytosine 
      (5hmC), is not well understood and is the subject of this study. Vertebrate Tet 
      proteins are 5-methylcytosine (5mC) hydroxylases enzymes catalyzing the 
      transition of 5mC to 5hmC in DNA and have recently been shown to have the same 
      function in messenger RNAs in both vertebrates and in Drosophila. The Tet gene is 
      essential in Drosophila because Tet knock-out animals do not reach adulthood. We 
      describe the identification of Tet-target genes in the embryo and larval brain by 
      determining Tet DNA-binding sites throughout the genome and by mapping the 
      Tet-dependent 5hmrC modifications transcriptome-wide. 5hmrC-modified sites can be 
      found along the entire transcript and are preferentially located at the promoter 
      where they overlap with histone H3K4me3 peaks. The identified mRNAs are 
      frequently involved in neuron and axon development and Tet knock-out led to a 
      reduction of 5hmrC marks on specific mRNAs. Among the Tet-target genes were the 
      robo2 receptor and its slit ligand that function in axon guidance in Drosophila 
      and in vertebrates. Tet knock-out embryos show overlapping phenotypes with robo2 
      and are sensitized to reduced levels of slit . Both Robo2 and Slit protein levels 
      were markedly reduced in Tet KO larval brains. Our results establish a role for 
      Tet-dependent 5hmrC in facilitating the translation of modified mRNAs, primarily 
      in developing nerve cells.

AB  - The flagellated kinetoplastid protozoan and causative agent of human Chagas 
      disease, Trypanosoma cruzi , inhabits both invertebrate and mammalian hosts over 
      the course of its complex life cycle. In these disparate environments, T. cruzi 
      uses its single flagellum to propel motile life stages and in some instances, to 
      establish intimate contact with the host. Beyond its role in motility, the 
      functional capabilities of the T. cruzi flagellum have not been defined. 
      Moreover, the lack of proteomic information for this organelle, in any parasite 
      life stage, has limited functional investigation. In this study, we employed a 
      proximity-dependent biotinylation approach based on the differential targeting of 
      the biotin ligase, TurboID, to the flagellum or cytosol in replicative stages of 
      T. cruzi , to identify flagellar-enriched proteins by mass spectrometry. 
      Proteomic analysis of the resulting biotinylated protein fractions yielded 218 
      candidate flagellar proteins in T. cruzi epimastigotes (insect stage) and 99 
      proteins in intracellular amastigotes (mammalian stage). Forty of these 
      flagellar-enriched proteins were common to both parasite life stages and included 
      orthologs of known flagellar proteins in other trypanosomatid species, proteins 
      specific to the T. cruzi lineage and hypothetical proteins. With the validation 
      of flagellar localization for several of the identified candidates, our results 
      demonstrate that TurboID-based proximity proteomics is an effective tool for 
      probing subcellular compartments in T. cruzi . The proteomic datasets generated 
      in this work offer a valuable resource to facilitate functional investigation of 
      the understudied T. cruzi flagellum.

AB  - Well-controlled metabolism is the prerequisite for optimal oocyte development. To 
      date, numerous studies have focused mainly on the utilization of exogenous 
      substrates by oocytes, whereas the underlying mechanism of intrinsic regulation 
      during meiotic maturation is less characterized. Herein, we performed an 
      integrated analysis of parallel metabolomics and transcriptomics by isolating 
      porcine oocytes at three time points, cooperatively depicting the global picture 
      of the metabolic patterns during maturation. In particular, we identified the 
      novel metabolic features during porcine oocyte meiosis, such as the fall in bile 
      acids, the active one-carbon metabolism and a progressive decline in nucleotide 
      metabolism. Collectively, the current study not only provides a comprehensive 
      multiple omics data resource, but also may facilitate the discovery of molecular 
      biomarkers that could be used to predict and improve oocyte quality.

AB  - The quality of colostrum is a key factor contributing to healthy calf growth, and 
      pasteurization of colostrum can effectively reduce the counts of pathogenic 
      microorganisms present in the colostrum. Physiological changes in calves fed with 
      pasteurized colostrum have been well characterized, but little is known about the 
      underlying molecular mechanisms. In this study, key genes and functional pathways 
      through which pasteurized colostrum affects calf growth were identified through 
      whole blood RNA sequencing. Our results showed that calves in the pasteurized 
      group (n = 16) had higher body height and daily weight gain than those in the 
      unpasteurized group (n = 16) in all months tested. Importantly, significant 
      differences in body height were observed at 3 and 4 months of age (p < 0.05), and 
      in daily weight gain at 2, 3, and 6 months of age (p < 0.05) between the two 
      groups. Based on whole blood transcriptome data from 6-months old calves, 630 
      differentially expressed genes (DEGs), of which 235 were upregulated and 395 
      downregulated, were identified in the pasteurized compared to the unpasteurized 
      colostrum groups. Most of the DEGs have functions in the immune response (e.g., 
      CCL3, CXCL3, and IL1A) and metabolism (e.g., PTX3 and EXTL1). Protein-protein 
      interaction analyses of DEGs revealed three key subnetworks and fifteen core 
      genes, including UBA52 and RPS28, that have roles in protein synthesis, oxidative 
      phosphorylation, and inflammatory responses. Twelve co-expression modules were 
      identified through weighted gene co-expression network analysis. Among them, 17 
      genes in the two modules that significantly associated with pasteurization were 
      mainly involved in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, NF-kappa B signaling, and 
      NOD-like receptor signaling pathways. Finally, DEGs that underwent alternative 
      splicing in calves fed pasteurized colostrum have roles in the immune response 
      (SLCO4A1, AKR1C4, and MED13L), indicative of potential roles in immune 
      regulation. Results from multiple analytical methods used suggest that 
      differences in calf growth between the pasteurized and unpasteurized groups may 
      be due to differential immune activity. Our data provide new insights into the 
      impact of pasteurization on calf immune and metabolic-related pathways through 
      its effects on gene expression.

AB  - Declining cerebral blood flow leads to chronic cerebral hypoperfusion which can 
      induce neurodegenerative disorders, such as vascular dementia. The reduced energy 
      supply of the brain impairs mitochondrial functions that could trigger further 
      damaging cellular processes. We carried out stepwise bilateral common carotid 
      occlusions on rats and investigated long-term mitochondrial, 
      mitochondria-associated membrane (MAM), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteome 
      changes. Samples were studied by gel-based and mass spectrometry-based proteomic 
      analyses. We found 19, 35, and 12 significantly altered proteins in the 
      mitochondria, MAM, and CSF, respectively. Most of the changed proteins were 
      involved in protein turnover and import in all three sample types. We confirmed 
      decreased levels of proteins involved in protein folding and amino acid 
      catabolism, such as P4hb and Hibadh in the mitochondria by western blot. We 
      detected reduced levels of several components of protein synthesis and 
      degradation in the CSF as well as in the subcellular fractions, implying that 
      hypoperfusion-induced altered protein turnover of brain tissue can be detected in 
      the CSF by proteomic analysis.

TI  - CRISPR screens identify novel regulators of cFLIP dependency and 
      ligand-independent, TRAIL-R1-mediated cell death.
PG  - 1221-1234
LID - 10.1038/s41418-023-01133-0 [doi]
AB  - Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) causes primary effusion lymphoma 
      (PEL). PEL cell lines require expression of the cellular FLICE inhibitory protein 
      (cFLIP) for survival, although KSHV encodes a viral homolog of this protein 
      (vFLIP). Cellular and viral FLIP proteins have several functions, including, most 
      importantly, the inhibition of pro-apoptotic caspase 8 and modulation of NF-κB 
      signaling. To investigate the essential role of cFLIP and its potential 
      redundancy with vFLIP in PEL cells, we first performed rescue experiments with 
      human or viral FLIP proteins known to affect FLIP target pathways differently. 
      The long and short isoforms of cFLIP and molluscum contagiosum virus MC159L, 
      which are all strong caspase 8 inhibitors, efficiently rescued the loss of 
      endogenous cFLIP activity in PEL cells. KSHV vFLIP was unable to fully rescue the 
      loss of endogenous cFLIP and is therefore functionally distinct. Next, we 
      employed genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 synthetic rescue screens to identify loss of 
      function perturbations that can compensate for cFLIP knockout. Results from these 
      screens and our validation experiments implicate the canonical cFLIP target 
      caspase 8 and TRAIL receptor 1 (TRAIL-R1 or TNFRSF10A) in promoting constitutive 
      death signaling in PEL cells. However, this process was independent of TRAIL 
      receptor 2 or TRAIL, the latter of which is not detectable in PEL cell cultures. 
      The requirement for cFLIP is also overcome by inactivation of the ER/Golgi 
      resident chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan synthesis and UFMylation pathways, 
      Jagunal homolog 1 (JAGN1) or CXCR4. UFMylation and JAGN1, but not chondroitin 
      sulfate proteoglycan synthesis or CXCR4, contribute to TRAIL-R1 expression. In 
      sum, our work shows that cFLIP is required in PEL cells to inhibit 
      ligand-independent TRAIL-R1 cell death signaling downstream of a complex set of 
      ER/Golgi-associated processes that have not previously been implicated in cFLIP 
      or TRAIL-R1 function.

      metabolic programs by altering the 3D genome compartmentalization.
LID - rs.3.rs-2537075 [pii]
LID - 10.21203/rs.3.rs-2537075/v1 [doi]
AB  - Uterine fibroid (UF) tumors originate from a mutated smooth muscle cell (SMC). 
      Nearly 70% of these tumors are driven by hotspot recurrent somatic mutations in 
      the MED12 gene; however, there are no tractable genetic models to study the 
      biology of UF tumors because, under culture conditions, the non-mutant 
      fibroblasts outgrow the mutant SMC cells, resulting in the conversion of the 
      population to WT phenotype. The lack of faithful cellular models hampered our 
      ability to delineate the molecular pathways downstream of MED12 mutations and 
      identify therapeutics that may selectively target the mutant cells. To overcome 
      this challenge, we employed CRISPR knock-in with a sensitive PCR-based screening 
      strategy to precisely engineer cells with mutant MED12 Gly44, which constitutes 
      50% of MED12 exon two mutations. Critically, the engineered myometrial SMC cells 
      recapitulate several UF-like cellular, transcriptional and metabolic alterations, 
      including enhanced proliferation rates in 3D spheres and altered 
      Tryptophan/kynurenine metabolism. Our transcriptomic analysis supported by DNA 
      synthesis tracking reveals that MED12 mutant cells, like UF tumors, have 
      heightened expression of DNA repair genes but reduced DNA synthesis rates. 
      Consequently, these cells accumulate significantly higher rates of DNA damage and 
      are selectively more sensitive to common DNA-damaging chemotherapy, indicating 
      mutation-specific and therapeutically relevant vulnerabilities. Our 
      high-resolution 3D chromatin interaction analysis demonstrates that the 
      engineered MED12 mutations drive aberrant genomic activity due to a genome-wide 
      chromatin compartmentalization switch. These findings indicate that the 
      engineered cellular model faithfully models key features of UF tumors and 
      provides a novel platform for the broader scientific community to characterize 
      genomics of recurrent MED12 mutations and discover potential therapeutic targets.

LID - 10.21203/rs.3.rs-2524562/v1 [doi]
AB  - Cancer-induced muscle wasting reduces quality of life, complicates or precludes 
      cancer treatments, and predicts early mortality. Herein, we investigated the 
      requirement of the muscle-specific E3 ubiquitin ligase, MuRF1, for muscle wasting 
      induced by pancreatic cancer. Murine pancreatic cancer (KPC) cells, or saline, 
      were injected into the pancreas of WT and MuRF1-/- mice, and tissues analyzed 
      throughout tumor progression. KPC tumors induced progressive wasting of skeletal 
      muscle and systemic metabolic reprogramming in WT mice, but not MuRF1-/- mice. 
      KPC tumors from MuRF1-/- mice also grew slower, and showed an accumulation of 
      metabolites normally depleted by rapidly growing tumors. Mechanistically, MuRF1 
      was necessary for the KPC-induced increases in cytoskeletal and muscle 
      contractile protein ubiquitination, and the depression of proteins that support 
      protein synthesis. Together, these data demonstrate that MuRF1 is required for 
      KPC-induced skeletal muscle wasting, whose deletion reprograms the systemic and 
      tumor metabolome and delays tumor growth.

AB  - Microorganisms play very important roles in carcinogenesis, tumor progression, 
      and resistance upon treatment. Due to the challenge of accurately acquiring 
      samples and quantifying low-biomass tissue microorganisms, most studies have 
      focused on the effect of gut microorganisms on cancer treatments, especially the 
      efficacy of immunotherapy. Although recent publications reveal the potential 
      interactions between intratumor microorganisms and the immune microenvironment, 
      whether and to what extent the intratumor microorganism could affect progression 
      and treatment outcome remain controversial. This study is aiming to evaluate the 
      associations among intratumor microorganisms, DNA methylation cancer driver 
      genes, immune response, and clinical outcomes from a pan-cancer perspective, 
      using 6,876 TCGA samples across 21 cancer types. We revealed that tumor 
      microorganism dysbiosis is closely associated with the abnormal tumor methylome 
      and/or tumor microenvironment, which might serve to enhance the proliferation 
      ability and fitness for the therapy of tumors. These findings shed the light on a 
      better understanding of the interactions between tumor cells and carcinogens 
      during and after tumor formation, as well as microorganism-associated methylation 
      alterations that could further serve as biomarkers for clinical outcome 
      assessment.

TI  - Ultra-low-coverage genome-wide association study-insights into gestational age 
      using 17,844 embryo samples with preimplantation genetic testing.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Very low-coverage (0.1 to 1×) whole genome sequencing (WGS) has 
      become a promising and affordable approach to discover genomic variants of human 
      populations for genome-wide association study (GWAS). To support genetic 
      screening using preimplantation genetic testing (PGT) in a large population, the 
      sequencing coverage goes below 0.1× to an ultra-low level. However, the 
      feasibility and effectiveness of ultra-low-coverage WGS (ulcWGS) for GWAS remains 
      undetermined. METHODS: We built a pipeline to carry out analysis of ulcWGS data 
      for GWAS. To examine its effectiveness, we benchmarked the accuracy of genotype 
      imputation at the combination of different coverages below 0.1× and sample sizes 
      from 2000 to 16,000, using 17,844 embryo PGT samples with approximately 0.04× 
      average coverage and the standard Chinese sample HG005 with known genotypes. We 
      then applied the imputed genotypes of 1744 transferred embryos who have 
      gestational ages and complete follow-up records to GWAS. RESULTS: The accuracy of 
      genotype imputation under ultra-low coverage can be improved by increasing the 
      sample size and applying a set of filters. From 1744 born embryos, we identified 
      11 genomic risk loci associated with gestational ages and 166 genes mapped to 
      these loci according to positional, expression quantitative trait locus, and 
      chromatin interaction strategies. Among these mapped genes, CRHBP, ICAM1, and 
      OXTR were more frequently reported as preterm birth related. By joint analysis of 
      gene expression data from previous studies, we constructed interrelationships of 
      mainly CRHBP, ICAM1, PLAGL1, DNMT1, CNTLN, DKK1, and EGR2 with preterm birth, 
      infant disease, and breast cancer. CONCLUSIONS: This study not only demonstrates 
      that ulcWGS could achieve relatively high accuracy of adequate genotype 
      imputation and is capable of GWAS, but also provides insights into the 
      associations between gestational age and genetic variations of the fetal embryos 
      from Chinese population.

TI  - 1700029I15Rik orchestrates the biosynthesis of acrosomal membrane proteins 
      required for sperm-egg interaction.

AB  - Sperm acrosomal membrane proteins, such as Izumo sperm-egg fusion 1 (IZUMO1) and 
      sperm acrosome-associated 6 (SPACA6), play essential roles in mammalian gamete 
      binding or fusion. How their biosynthesis is regulated during spermiogenesis has 
      largely remained elusive. Here, we show that 1700029I15Rik knockout male mice are 
      severely subfertile and their spermatozoa do not fuse with eggs. 1700029I15Rik is 
      a type-II transmembrane protein expressed in early round spermatids but not in 
      mature spermatozoa. It interacts with proteins involved in N-linked 
      glycosylation, disulfide isomerization, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi 
      trafficking, suggesting a potential role in nascent protein processing. The 
      ablation of 1700029I15Rik destabilizes non-catalytic subunits of the 
      oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex that are pivotal for N-glycosylation. The 
      knockout testes exhibit normal expression of sperm plasma membrane proteins, but 
      decreased abundance of multiple acrosomal membrane proteins involved in 
      fertilization. The knockout sperm show upregulated chaperones related to 
      ER-associated degradation (ERAD) and elevated protein ubiquitination; strikingly, 
      SPACA6 becomes undetectable. Our results support for a specific, 
      1700029I15Rik-mediated pathway underpinning the biosynthesis of acrosomal 
      membrane proteins during spermiogenesis.

TI  - Transcriptomics secondary analysis of severe human infection with SARS-CoV-2 
      identifies gene expression changes and predicts three transcriptional biomarkers

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of COVID-19, which has greatly affected human 
      health since it first emerged. Defining the human factors and biomarkers that 
      differentiate severe SARS-CoV-2 infection from mild infection has become of 
      increasing interest to clinicians. To help address this need, we retrieved 269 
      public RNA-seq human transcriptome samples from GEO that had qualitative disease 
      severity metadata. We then subjected these samples to a robust RNA-seq data 
      processing workflow to calculate gene expression in PBMCs, whole blood, and 
      leukocytes, as well as to predict transcriptional biomarkers in PBMCs and 
      leukocytes. This process involved using Salmon for read mapping, edgeR to 
      calculate significant differential expression levels, and gene ontology 
      enrichment using Camera. We then performed a random forest machine learning 
      analysis on the read counts data to identify genes that best classified samples 
      based on the COVID-19 severity phenotype. This approach produced a ranked list of 
      leukocyte genes based on their Gini values that includes TGFBI, TTYH2, and CD4, 
      which are associated with both the immune response and inflammation. Our results 
      show that these three genes can potentially classify samples with severe COVID-19 
      with accuracy of ∼88% and an area under the receiver operating characteristic 
      curve of 92.6--indicating acceptable specificity and sensitivity. We expect that 
      our findings can help contribute to the development of improved diagnostics that 
      may aid in identifying severe COVID-19 cases, guide clinical treatment, and 
      improve mortality rates.

AB  - Inhibition of PKC (PKCi) signaling maintains pluripotency of embryonic stem cells 
      (ESCs) across different mammalian species. However, the position of PKCi 
      maintained ESCs in the pluripotency continuum is largely unknown. Here we 
      demonstrate that mouse ESCs when cultured continuously, with PKCi, for 75 days 
      are retained in naïve state of pluripotency. Gene expression analysis and 
      proteomics studies demonstrated enhanced naïve character of PKCi maintained ESCs 
      in comparison to classical serum/LIF (S/L) supported ESCs. Molecular analysis 
      revealed that activation of PKCζ isoform associate with primed state of 
      pluripotency, present in epiblast-like stem cells generated in vitro while 
      inhibition of PKCζ phosphorylation associated with naïve state of pluripotency in 
      vitro and in vivo. Phosphoproteomics and chromatin modification enzyme array 
      based studies showed loss in DNA methyl transferase 3B (DNMT3B) and its 
      phosphorylation level upon functional inhibition of PKCζ as one of the crucial 
      components of this regulatory pathway. Unlike ground state of pluripotency 
      maintained by MEK/GSK3 inhibitor in addition to LIF (2i/LIF), loss in DNMT3B is a 
      reversible phenomenon in PKCi maintained ESCs. Absence of phosphorylation of 
      c-MYC, RAF1, SPRY4 while presence of ERF, DUSP6, CIC and YAP1 phosphorylation 
      underlined the phosphoproteomics signature of PKCi mediated maintenance of naïve 
      pluripotency. States of pluripotency represent the developmental continuum and 
      the existence of PKCi mediated mouse ESCs in a distinct state in the continuum of 
      pluripotency (DiSCo) might contribute to the establishment of stages of murine 
      embryonic development that were non-permissible till date.

TI  - Dual role of Apolipoprotein D as long-term instructive factor and acute signal 
      conditioning microglial secretory and phagocytic responses.
PG  - 1112930
LID - 10.3389/fncel.2023.1112930 [doi]
LID - 1112930
AB  - Microglial cells are recognized as very dynamic brain cells, screening the 
      environment and sensitive to signals from all other cell types in health and 
      disease. Apolipoprotein D (ApoD), a lipid-binding protein of the Lipocalin 
      family, is required for nervous system optimal function and proper development 
      and maintenance of key neural structures. ApoD has a cell and state-dependent 
      expression in the healthy nervous system, and increases its expression upon 
      aging, damage or neurodegeneration. An extensive overlap exists between processes 
      where ApoD is involved and those where microglia have an active role. However, no 
      study has analyzed the role of ApoD in microglial responses. In this work, we 
      test the hypothesis that ApoD, as an extracellular signal, participates in the 
      intercellular crosstalk sensed by microglia and impacts their responses upon 
      physiological aging or damaging conditions. We find that a significant proportion 
      of ApoD-dependent aging transcriptome are microglia-specific genes, and show that 
      lack of ApoD in vivo dysregulates microglial density in mouse hippocampus in an 
      age-dependent manner. Murine BV2 and primary microglia do not express ApoD, but 
      it can be internalized and targeted to lysosomes, where unlike other cell types 
      it is transiently present. Cytokine secretion profiles and myelin phagocytosis 
      reveal that ApoD has both long-term pre-conditioning effects on microglia as well 
      as acute effects on these microglial immune functions, without significant 
      modification of cell survival. ApoD-triggered cytokine signatures are stimuli 
      (paraquat vs. Aβ oligomers) and sex-dependent. Acute exposure to ApoD induces 
      microglia to switch from their resting state to a secretory and less phagocytic 
      phenotype, while long-term absence of ApoD leads to attenuated cytokine induction 
      and increased myelin uptake, supporting a role for ApoD as priming or immune 
      training factor. This knowledge should help to advance our understanding of the 
      complex responses of microglia during aging and neurodegeneration, where signals 
      received along our lifespan are combined with damage-triggered acute signals, 
      conditioning both beneficial roles and limitations of microglial functions.

      Cancer Using an Integrated Bioinformatics Approach.
PG  - 8538240

LID - 8538240
AB  - BACKGROUND: The relationship between H. pylori infection and gastric cancer (GC) 
      has been widely studied, and H. pylori is considered as the main factor. 
      Utilizing bioinformatics analysis, this study examined gene signatures related to 
      progressing H. pylori-associated GC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The dataset GSE13195 
      was chosen to search for abnormally expressed genes in H. pylori-associated GC 
      and normal tissues. The TCGA-STAD database was chosen to verify the expression of 
      key genes in GC and normal tissues. RESULTS: In GSE13195, a total of 332 
      differential expression genes (DEGs) were screened. The results of weighted gene 
      co-expression network analysis showed that the light cyan, plum2, black, and 
      magenta4 modules were associated with stages (T3, T2, and T4), while the 
      orangered4, salmon2, pink, and navajowhite2 modules were correlated with lymph 
      node metastasis (N3, N2, and N0). Based on the results of DEGs and hub genes, a 
      total of 7 key genes (ADAM28, FCER1G, MRPL14, SOSTDC1, TYROBP, C1QC, and C3) were 
      screened out. These gene mRNA levels were able to distinguish between normal and 
      H. pylori-associated GC tissue using receiver operating characteristic curves. 
      After transcriptional level verification and survival analysis, ADAM28 and C1QC 
      were excluded. An immune infiltration study revealed that key genes were involved 
      in regulating the infiltration levels of cells associated with innate immune 
      response, antigen presentation process, humoral immune response, or 
      Tcell-mediated immune response. In addition, drugs targeting FCER1G and TYROBP 
      have been approved and are under investigation. CONCLUSION: Our study identified 
      five key genes involved in H. pylori-associated GC tumorigenesis. Patients with 
      higher levels of C3 expression had a poorer prognosis than those with lower 
      levels. In addition, these key genes may serve as biomarkers and therapeutic 
      targets for H. pylori-associated GC diagnosis, targeted therapy, and 
      immunotherapy in the future.

      (GBR12909), a dopamine re-uptake inhibitor, was recently identified as having 
      anti-mycobacterial activity during a drug repurposing screening effort. However, 
      its effects on mycobacteria were not well characterized. Herein, we report 
      vanoxerine as a disruptor of the membrane electric potential, inhibiting 
      mycobacterial efflux and growth. Vanoxerine had an undetectable level of 
      resistance, highlighting the lack of a protein target. This study suggests a 
      mechanism of action for vanoxerine, which will allow for its continued 
      development or use as a tool compound.

AB  - Homeodomain transcription factors (HD TFs) are instrumental to vertebrate 
      development. Mutations in HD TFs have been linked to human diseases, but their 
      pathogenic mechanisms remain elusive. Here we use Cone-Rod Homeobox (CRX) as a 
      model to decipher the disease-causing mechanisms of two HD mutations, p.E80A and 
      p.K88N, that produce severe dominant retinopathies. Through integrated analysis 
      of molecular and functional evidence in vitro and in knock-in mouse models, we 
      uncover two novel gain-of-function mechanisms: p.E80A increases CRX-mediated 
      transactivation of canonical CRX target genes in developing photoreceptors; 
      p.K88N alters CRX DNA-binding specificity resulting in binding at ectopic sites 
      and severe perturbation of CRX target gene expression. Both mechanisms produce 
      novel retinal morphological defects and hinder photoreceptor maturation distinct 
      from loss-of-function models. This study reveals the distinct roles of E80 and 
      K88 residues in CRX HD regulatory functions and emphasizes the importance of 
      transcriptional precision in normal development.

AB  - The modification of intracellular proteins with O-linked β- N -acetylglucosamine 
      (O-GlcNAc) moieties is a highly dynamic process that spatiotemporally regulates 
      nearly every important cellular program. Despite its significance, little is 
      known about the substrate recognition and regulation modes of O-GlcNAc 
      transferase (OGT), the primary enzyme responsible for O-GlcNAc addition. In this 
      study, we have identified the intervening domain (Int-D), a poorly understood 
      protein fold found only in metazoan OGTs, as a specific regulator of OGT 
      protein-protein interactions and substrate modification. Utilizing an innovative 
      proteomic peptide phage display (ProP-PD) coupled with structural, biochemical, 
      and cellular characterizations, we discovered a novel peptide motif, employed by 
      the Int-D to facilitate specific O-GlcNAcylation. We further show that disruption 
      of Int-D binding dysregulates important cellular programs including nutrient 
      stress response and glucose metabolism. These findings illustrate a novel mode of 
      OGT substrate recognition and offer the first insights into the biological roles 
      of this unique domain.

AB  - Most organs in the body rely on blood flow, and vesicular damage is the leading 
      cause of injury in multiple organs. The endothelium, as the barriers of vessels, 
      play a critical role in ensuring vascular homeostasis and angiogenesis. The rapid 
      development of risk factors in endothelial injuries has been seen in the past 
      decade, such as smoking, infectious, and diabetes mellites. Pyroptotic 
      endothelium is an inflammatory mode of governed endothelial cell death that 
      depend on the metabolic disorder and severe infectious such as atherosclerosis, 
      and sepsis-related acute lung injury, respectively. Pyroptotic endothelial cells 
      need GSDMD cleaved into N- and C-terminal by caspase1, and the cytokines are 
      released by a pore constructed by the N-terminal of GSDMD in the membrane of ECs, 
      finally resulting in severe inflammation and pyroptotic cell death. This review 
      will focus on the patho-physiological and pharmacological pathways of pyroptotic 
      endothelial metabolism in diseases. Overall, this review indicates that 
      pyroptosis is a significant risk factor in diseases and a potential drug target 
      in related diseases.

TI  - Integrated Microarray-Based Data Analysis of miRNA Expression Profiles: 
      Identification of Novel Biomarkers of Cisplatin-Resistance in Testicular Germ 
      Cell Tumours.
LID - 10.3390/ijms24032495 [doi]
LID - 2495
AB  - Testicular germ cell tumours (TGCTs) are the most common solid malignancy among 
      young men, and their incidence is still increasing. Despite good curability with 
      cisplatin (CDDP)-based chemotherapy, about 10% of TGCTs are non-responsive and 
      show a chemoresistant phenotype. To further increase TGCT curability, better 
      prediction of risk of relapse and early detection of refractory cases is needed. 
      Therefore, to diagnose this malignancy more precisely, stratify patients more 
      accurately and improve decision-making on treatment modality, new biomarkers are 
      still required. Numerous studies showed association of differential expressions 
      of microRNAs (miRNAs) with cancer. Using microarray analysis followed by RT-qPCR 
      validation, we identified specific miRNA expression patterns that discriminate 
      chemoresistant phenotypes in TGCTs. Comparing CDDP-resistant vs. -sensitive TGCT 
      cell lines, we identified miR-218-5p, miR-31-5p, miR-125b-5p, miR-27b-3p, 
      miR-199a-5p, miR-214-3p, let-7a and miR-517a-3p as significantly up-regulated and 
      miR-374b-5p, miR-378a-3p, miR-20b-5p and miR-30e-3p as significantly 
      down-regulated. In patient tumour samples, we observed the highest median values 
      of relative expression of miR-218-5p, miR-31-5p, miR-375-5p and miR-517a-3p, but 
      also miR-20b-5p and miR-378a-3p, in metastatic tumour samples when compared with 
      primary tumour or control samples. In TGCT patient plasma samples, we detected 
      increased expression of miR-218-5p, miR-31-5p, miR-517a-3p and miR-375-5p when 
      compared to healthy individuals. We propose that miR-218-5p, miR-31-5p, 
      miR-375-5p, miR-517-3p, miR-20b-5p and miR-378a-3p represent a new panel of 
      biomarkers for better prediction of chemoresistance and more aggressive 
      phenotypes potentially underlying metastatic spread in non-seminomatous TGCTs. In 
      addition, we provide predictions of the targets and functional and regulatory 
      networks of selected miRNAs.

AB  - Dysfunctions of the ovaries and adrenal glands are both evidenced to cause 
      aberrant adipose tissue (AT) remodeling and resultant metabolic disorders, but 
      their distinct and common roles are poorly understood. In this study, through 
      biochemical, histological and RNA-seq analyses, we comprehensively explored the

      remodeling, in response to ovariectomy (OVX) versus adrenalectomy (ADX) in female 
      mice. OVX promoted adipocyte differentiation and fat accumulation in both SAT and 
      VAT, by potentiating the Pparg signaling, while ADX universally prevented the 
      cell proliferation and extracellular matrix organization in both SAT and VAT, 
      likely by inactivating the Nr3c1 signaling, thus causing lipoatrophy in females. 
      ADX, but not OVX, exerted great effects on the intrinsic difference between SAT 
      and VAT. Specifically, ADX reversed a large cluster of genes differentially 
      expressed between SAT and VAT, by activating 12 key transcription factors, and 
      thereby caused senescent cell accumulation, massive B cell infiltration and the 
      development of selective inflammatory response in SAT. Commonly, both OVX and ADX 
      enhance circadian rhythmicity in VAT, and impair cell proliferation, 
      neurogenesis, tissue morphogenesis, as well as extracellular matrix organization 
      in SAT, thus causing dysfunction of adipose tissues and concomitant metabolic 
      disorders.

AB  - Motivated by the clinical success of gold(I) metallotherapeutic Auranofin in the 
      effective treatment of both inflammatory and cancer diseases, we decided to 
      prepare, characterize, and further study the [Au(kin)(PPh(3))] complex (1), where 
      Hkin = kinetin, 6-furfuryladenine, for its in vitro anti-cancer and 
      anti-inflammatory activities. The results revealed that the complex (1) had 
      significant in vitro cytotoxicity against human cancer cell lines (A2780, A2780R, 
      PC-3, 22Rv1, and THP-1), with IC(50) ≈ 1-5 μM, which was even significantly 
      better than that for the conventional platinum-based drug Cisplatin while 
      comparable with Auranofin. Although its ability to inhibit transcription factor 
      NF-κB activity did not exceed the comparative drug Auranofin, it has been found 
      that it is able to positively influence peroxisome-proliferator-activated 
      receptor-gamma (PPARγ), and as a consequence of this to have the impact of 
      moderating/reducing inflammation. The cellular effects of the complex (1) in 
      A2780 cancer cells were also investigated by cell cycle analysis, induction of 
      apoptosis, intracellular ROS production, activation of caspases 3/7 and 
      disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential, and shotgun proteomic analysis. 
      Proteomic analysis of R2780 cells treated with complex (1) and starting compounds 
      revealed possible different places of the effect of the studied compounds. 
      Moreover, the time-dependent cellular accumulation of copper was studied by means 
      of the mass spectrometry study with the aim of exploring the possible mechanisms 
      responsible for its biological effects.

TI  - MiR-182 Is Upregulated in Prostate Cancer and Contributes to Tumor Progression by 
      Targeting MITF.
LID - 10.3390/ijms24031824 [doi]
LID - 1824
AB  - Altered expression of microRNA-182-5p (miR-182) has been consistently linked with 
      many cancers, but its specific role in prostate cancer remains unclear. In 
      particular, its contribution to epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in 
      this setting has not been well studied. Therefore, this paper profiles the 
      expression of miR-182 in prostate cancer and investigates how it may contribute 
      to progression of this disease. In vitro experiments on prostate cancer cell 
      lines and in silico analyses of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) prostate 
      adenocarcinoma (PRAD) datasets were performed. PCR revealed miR-182 expression 
      was significantly increased in prostate cancer cell lines compared to normal 
      prostate cells. Bioinformatic analysis of TCGA PRAD data similarly showed 
      upregulation of miR-182 was significantly associated with prostate cancer and 
      clinical markers of disease progression. Functional enrichment analysis confirmed 
      a significant association of miR-182 and its target genes with EMT. The 
      EMT-linked gene MITF (melanocyte inducing transcription factor) was subsequently 
      shown to be a novel target of miR-182 in prostate cancer cells. Further TCGA 
      analysis suggested miR-182 expression can be an indicator of patient outcomes and 
      disease progression following therapy. In summary, this is the first study to 
      report that miR-182 over-expression in prostate cancer may contribute to EMT by 
      targeting MITF expression. We propose miR-182 as a potentially useful diagnostic 
      and prognostic biomarker for prostate cancer and other malignancies.

TI  - Macrophages Promote Ovarian Cancer-Mesothelial Cell Adhesion by Upregulation of 
      ITGA2 and VEGFC in Mesothelial Cells.
LID - 10.3390/cells12030384 [doi]
LID - 384
AB  - Ovarian cancer is a metastatic disease that frequently exhibits extensive 
      peritoneal dissemination. Recent studies have revealed that noncancerous cells 
      inside the tumor microenvironment, such as macrophages and mesothelial cells, may 
      play a role in ovarian cancer metastasis. In this study, we found that human 
      ovarian cancer cells (A2780 and SKOV3) adhered more to human mesothelial Met5A 
      cells stimulated by macrophages (M-Met5A) in comparison to unstimulated control 
      Met5A cells. The mRNA sequencing revealed that 94 adhesion-related genes, 
      including FMN1, ITGA2, COL13A1, VEGFC, and NRG1, were markedly upregulated in 
      M-Met5A cells. Knockdown of ITGA2 and VEGFC in M-Met5A cells significantly 
      inhibited the adhesion of ovarian cancer cells. Inhibition of the JNK and Akt 
      signaling pathways suppressed ITGA2 and VEGFC expression in M-Met5A cells as well 
      as ovarian cancer-mesothelial cell adhesion. Furthermore, increased production of 
      CC chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) and CCL5 by macrophages elevated ovarian 
      cancer-mesothelial cell adhesion. These findings imply that macrophages may play 
      a significant role in ovarian cancer-mesothelial cell adhesion by inducing the 
      mesothelial expression of adhesion-related genes via the JNK and Akt pathways.

TI  - Candidate Genes and Pathways in Cervical Cancer: A Systematic Review and 
      Integrated Bioinformatic Analysis.
LID - 10.3390/cancers15030853 [doi]
LID - 853
AB  - Cervical cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death among women in 
      developing countries. However, no comprehensive molecular mechanism for cervical 
      cancer has been established, as many studies were small-cohort studies conducted 
      with small sample sizes. A thorough literature search was performed using the 
      PubMed, Scopus, EBSCOhost, and Science Direct databases. Medical Subject Heading 
      (MeSH) terms such as "Uterine Cervical Neoplasms" and "gene expression" were used 
      as the keywords in all fields. A total of 4027 studies were retrieved, and only 
      clinical studies, which used the microarray method to identify differentially 
      expressed genes (DEGs) in the cervical tissue of cervical cancer patients, were 
      selected. Following the screening, 6 studies were selected and 1128 DEGs were 
      extracted from the data. Sixty-two differentially expressed genes from at least 
      two studies were selected for further analysis by DAVID, STRING, and Cytoscape 
      software. In cervical cancer pathogenesis, three significant clusters with high 
      intermolecular interactions from the Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) network 
      complex revealed three major molecular mechanisms, including cell signaling, cell 
      cycle, and cell differentiation. Subsequently, eight genes were chosen as the 
      candidate genes based on their involvement in the relevant gene ontology (GO) and 
      their interaction with other genes in the PPI network through undirected first 
      neighbor nodes. The present systematic review improves our understanding of the 
      molecular mechanism of cervical cancer and the proposed genes that can be used to 
      expand the biomarker panel in the screening for cervical cancer. The targeted 
      genes may be beneficial for the development of better treatment strategies.

AB  - Occupational exposure to potentially toxic elements (PTEs) is a concerning 
      reality of informal workers engaged in the jewelry production chain that can lead 
      to adverse health effects. In this study, untargeted proteomic and metabolomic 
      analyses were employed to assess the impact of these exposures on informal 
      workers' exposome in Limeira city, São Paulo state, Brazil. PTE levels (Cr, Mn, 
      Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Cd, Sn, Sb, Hg, and Pb) were determined in blood, proteomic 
      analyses were performed for saliva samples (n = 26), and metabolomic analyses in 
      plasma (n = 145) using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) 
      coupled with quadrupole-time-of-flight (Q-TOF) mass spectrometry. Blood PTE 
      levels of workers, controls, and their family members were determined by 
      inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). High concentration levels 
      of Sn and Cu were detected in welders' blood (p < 0.001). Statistical analyses 
      were performed using MetaboAnalyst 4.0. The results showed that 26 proteins were 
      upregulated, and 14 proteins downregulated on the welder group, and thirty of 
      these proteins were also correlated with blood Pb, Cu, Sb, and Sn blood levels in 
      the welder group (p < 0.05). Using gene ontology analysis of these 40 proteins 
      revealed the biological processes related to the upregulated proteins were 
      translational initiation, SRP-dependent co-translational protein targeting to 
      membrane, and viral transcription. A Metabolome-Wide Association Study (MWAS) was 
      performed to search for associations between blood metabolites and exposure 
      groups. A pathway enrichment analysis of significant features from the MWAS was 
      then conducted with Mummichog. A total of 73 metabolomic compounds and 40 
      proteins up or down-regulated in welders were used to perform a multi-omics 
      analysis, disclosing seven metabolic pathways potentially disturbed by the 
      informal work: valine leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis, valine leucine and 
      isoleucine degradation, arginine and proline metabolism, ABC transporters, 
      central carbon metabolism in cancer, arachidonic acid metabolism and cysteine and 
      methionine metabolism. The majority of the proteins found to be statistically up 
      or downregulated in welders also correlated with at least one blood PTE level, 
      providing insights into the biological responses to PTE exposures in the informal 
      work exposure scenario. These findings shed new light on the effects of 
      occupational activity on workers' exposome, underscoring the harmful effects of 
      PTE.

AB  - Driver event discovery is a crucial demand for breast cancer diagnosis and 
      therapy. In particular, discovering subtype-specificity of drivers can prompt the 
      personalized biomarker discovery and precision treatment of cancer patients. 
      Still, most of the existing computational driver discovery studies mainly exploit 
      the information from DNA aberrations and gene interactions. Notably, cancer 
      driver events would occur due to not only DNA aberrations but also RNA 
      alternations, but integrating multi-type aberrations from both DNA and RNA is 
      still a challenging task for breast cancer drivers. On the one hand, the data 
      formats of different aberration types also differ from each other, known as data 
      format incompatibility. On the other hand, different types of aberrations 
      demonstrate distinct patterns across samples, known as aberration type 
      heterogeneity. To promote the integrated analysis of subtype-specific breast 
      cancer drivers, we design a "splicing-and-fusing" framework to address the issues 
      of data format incompatibility and aberration type heterogeneity simultaneously. 
      To overcome the data format incompatibility, the "splicing-step" employs a 
      knowledge graph structure to connect multi-type aberrations from the DNA and RNA 
      data into a unified formation. To tackle the aberration type heterogeneity, the 
      "fusing-step" adopts a dynamic mapping gene space integration approach to 
      represent the multi-type information by vectorized profiles. The experiments also 
      demonstrate the advantages of our approach in both the integration of multi-type 
      aberrations from DNA and RNA and the discovery of subtype-specific breast cancer 
      drivers. In summary, our "splicing-and-fusing" framework with knowledge graph 
      connection and dynamic mapping gene space fusion of multi-type aberrations data 
      from DNA and RNA can successfully discover potential breast cancer drivers with 
      subtype-specificity indication.

AB  - Fabry disease (FD), a lysosomal storage disorder, is caused by defective 
      α-galactosidase (GLA) activity, which results in the accumulation of 
      globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) in endothelial cells and leads to life-threatening 
      complications such as left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), renal failure, and 
      stroke. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) results in Gb3 clearance; however, 
      because of a short half-life in the body and the high immunogenicity of FD 
      patients, ERT has a limited therapeutic effect, particularly in patients with 
      late-onset disease or progressive complications. Because vascular endothelial 
      cells (VECs) derived from FD-induced pluripotent stem cells display increased 
      thrombospondin-1 (TSP1) expression and enhanced SMAD2 signaling, we screened for 
      chemical compounds that could downregulate TSP1 and SMAD2 signaling. Fasudil 
      reduced the levels of p-SMAD2 and TSP1 in FD-VECs and increased the expression of 
      angiogenic factors. Furthermore, fasudil downregulated the 
      endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) and mitochondrial function of 
      FD-VECs. Oral administration of fasudil to FD mice alleviated several FD 
      phenotypes, including LVH, renal fibrosis, anhidrosis, and heat insensitivity. 
      Our findings demonstrate that fasudil is a novel candidate for FD therapy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Ischemic stroke (IS) is a serious neurological disease that largely 
      results in long-term disability and death. Extensive evidence has indicated that 
      the activation of inflammation and ferroptosis significantly contribute to the 
      development of IS pathology. However, the underlying molecular mechanism remains 
      unclear. In this study, we aimed to identify potential biomarkers associated with 
      IS through the construction of a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network and to 
      investigate the possible inflammatory and ferroptosis-related molecular 
      mechanisms. RESULTS: We identified 178 differentially expressed target messenger 
      RNAs (DETmRNAs) associated with IS. As revealed through enrichment analysis, the 
      DEmRNAs were mainly enriched in the inflammatory signaling pathways and also 
      related to ferroptosis mechanism. The CIBERSORT algorithm showed immune 
      infiltration landscapes in which the naïve B cells, naïve T cells, and monocytes 
      had statistically different numbers in the cerebral infarction group compared 
      with the control group. A ceRNA network was constructed in this study involving 
      44 long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), 15 microRNAs (miRNAs), and 160 messenger RNAs 
      (mRNAs). We used the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to identify 
      three miRNAs (miR-103a-3p, miR-140-3p, and miR-17-5p), one mRNA (TLR4), and one 
      lncRNA (NEAT1) as the potential key biomarkers of the ceRNA network. The key mRNA 
      and lncRNA were shown to be highly related to the ferroptosis mechanism of IS. 
      The expression of these key biomarkers was also further validated by a method of 
      quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction in SH-SY5Y cells, and the 
      validated results were consistent with the findings predicted by bioinformatics. 
      CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the ceRNA network may exert an important 
      role in the inflammatory and ferroptosis molecular mechanisms of IS, providing 
      new insight into therapeutic IS targets.

TI  - Tomato APETALA2 family member SlTOE1 regulates inflorescence branching by 
      repressing SISTER OF TM3.
PG  - 293-306
LID - 10.1093/plphys/kiad075 [doi]
AB  - Inflorescence architecture directly impacts yield potential in most crops. As a 
      model of sympodial plants, tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) inflorescence exhibits 
      highly structural plasticity. However, the genetic regulatory network of 
      inflorescence architecture in tomato remains unclear. Here, we investigated a 
      modulator of inflorescence branching in tomato, TARGET OF EAT1 (SlTOE1), an 
      APETALA2 (AP2) family member found to be predominantly expressed in the floral 
      meristem (FM) of tomato. sltoe1 knockout mutants displayed highly branched 
      inflorescences and defective floral organs. Transcriptome analysis revealed that 
      SISTER OF TM3 (STM3) and certain floral development-related genes were 
      upregulated in the flower meristem of sltoe1. SlTOE1 could directly bind the 
      promoters of STM3 and Tomato MADS-box gene 3 (TM3) to repress their 
      transcription. Simultaneous mutation of STM3 and TM3 partially restored the 
      inflorescence branching of the sltoe1cr mutants, suggesting that SlTOE1 regulates 
      inflorescence development, at least in part through an SlTOE1STM3/TM3 module. 
      Genetic analysis showed that SlTOE1 and ENHANCER OF JOINTLESS 2 (EJ2) additively 
      regulate tomato inflorescence branching; their double mutants showed more 
      extensive inflorescence branching. Our findings uncover a pathway controlling 
      tomato inflorescence branching and offer deeper insight into the functions of AP2 
      subfamily members.

AB  - Androgen receptor variant 7 (AR-V7), an AR isoform with a truncated 
      ligand-binding domain, functions as a transcription factor in an 
      androgen-independent manner. AR-V7 is expressed in a subpopulation of 
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), however, its role(s) in this cancer is undefined. 
      In this study, we investigated the potential roles of AR-V7 in 
      hepatocarcinogenesis in vivo in a c-MYC-driven mouse HCC model generated by the 
      hydrodynamic tail-vein injection system. The impacts of AR-V7 on gene expression 
      in mouse HCC were elucidated by RNA-seq transcriptome and ontology analyses. The 
      results showed that AR-V7 significantly exacerbated the c-MYC-mediated 
      oncogenesis in the livers of both sexes. The transcriptome and bioinformatics 
      analyses revealed that AR-V7 and c-MYC synergistically altered the gene sets 
      involved in various cancer-related biological processes, particularly in lipid 
      and steroid/sterol metabolisms. Importantly, AR-V7 suppressed a tumor suppressor 
      Claudin 7 expression, upregulated by c-MYC overexpression via the p53 signaling 
      pathway. Claudin 7 overexpression significantly suppressed the c-MYC-driven HCC 
      development under p53-deficient conditions. Our results suggest that the AR-V7 
      exacerbates the c-MYC-driven hepatocarcinogenesis by potentiating the oncogenic 
      roles and minimizing the anti-oncogenic functions of c-MYC. Since AR-V7 is 
      expressed in a subpopulation of HCC cases, it could contribute to the inter- and 
      intra-heterogeneity of HCC.

TI  - Comprehensive structural characterization of the human AAA+ disaggregase CLPB in 
      the apo- and substrate-bound states reveals a unique mode of action driven by 
      oligomerization.
PG  - e3001987

LID - e3001987
AB  - The human AAA+ ATPase CLPB (SKD3) is a protein disaggregase in the mitochondrial 
      intermembrane space (IMS) and functions to promote the solubilization of various 
      mitochondrial proteins. Loss-of-function CLPB mutations are associated with a few 
      human diseases with neutropenia and neurological disorders. Unlike canonical AAA+ 
      proteins, CLPB contains a unique ankyrin repeat domain (ANK) at its N-terminus. 
      How CLPB functions as a disaggregase and the role of its ANK domain are currently 
      unclear. Herein, we report a comprehensive structural characterization of human 
      CLPB in both the apo- and substrate-bound states. CLPB assembles into 
      homo-tetradecamers in apo-state and is remodeled into homo-dodecamers upon 
      substrate binding. Conserved pore-loops (PLs) on the ATPase domains form a spiral 
      staircase to grip and translocate the substrate in a step-size of 2 amino acid 
      residues. The ANK domain is not only responsible for maintaining the higher-order 
      assembly but also essential for the disaggregase activity. Interactome analysis 
      suggests that the ANK domain may directly interact with a variety of 
      mitochondrial substrates. These results reveal unique properties of CLPB as a 
      general disaggregase in mitochondria and highlight its potential as a target for 
      the treatment of various mitochondria-related diseases.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the effects and mechanisms of berberine in the treatment of 
      aging-related cognitive dysfunction based on network pharmacology methods, 
      molecular docking techniques, and animal experiments. METHODS: A mouse model of 
      cognitive dysfunction was constructed by subcutaneous injection of D-galactose 
      (D-gal) for 10 weeks, and the neuroprotective effects of berberine on 
      aging-related cognitive dysfunction mice were evaluated by the Morris water maze 
      (MWM) and immunofluorescence staining. The targets of berberine were obtained by 
      SwissTargetPrediction, GeneCards, and PharmMapper. Putative targets of cognitive 
      dysfunction were obtained by GeneCards, TTD, and DrugBank database. The STRING 
      database and Cytoscape software were applied for protein-protein interaction 
      (PPI) analysis and further screening of core targets. The DAVID database was used 
      for Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and gene ontology (GO) 
      enrichment analysis to clarify the biological processes and pathways involved in 
      the intersection targets, and AutoDockTools was adopted for molecular docking 
      verification of core targets. Finally, the core genes were validated using 
      real-time quantitative PCR. RESULTS: The MWM results showed that treatment with 
      berberine significantly improved spatial learning and memory in mice with 
      cognitive decline induced by D-gal. Immunofluorescence staining indicated that 
      berberine modified the levels of aging-related markers in the brain. A total of 
      386 berberine putative targets associated with cognitive dysfunction were 
      identified based on the public database. The core targets of berberine for 
      improving cognitive function, include Mapk1, Src, Ctnnb1, Akt1, Pik3ca, Tp53, 
      Jun, and Hsp90aa1. GO enrichment and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses indicated 
      that the mechanism of berberine in the treatment of aging-related cognitive 
      dysfunction is attributed to pathways such as PI3K-AKT and MAPK pathways. In vivo 
      experiments further confirmed that Akt1, Ctnnb1, Tp53, and Jun were involved in 
      the neuroprotective actions of berberine. CONCLUSION: This study reveals the 
      multi-target and multi-pathway effects of berberine on regulating aging-related 
      cognitive dysfunction, which provides preclinical evidence and may promote new 
      drug development in mitigating cognitive dysfunction.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Neurons require iron to support their metabolism, growth, and 
      differentiation, but are also susceptible to iron-induced oxidative stress and 
      cytotoxicity. Ferritin, a cytosolic iron storage unit, mediates cellular 
      adaptation to fluctuations in iron delivery. NCOA4 has been characterized as a 
      selective autophagic cargo receptor facilitating the mobilization of 
      intracellular iron from ferritin. This process named ferritinophagy results in 
      the degradation of ferritin and the consequent release of iron into the cytosol. 
      METHODS: Here we demonstrate that NCOA4 is important for the adaptation of the 
      HT22 mouse hippocampal neuronal cell line to cellular iron restriction. 
      Additionally, we determined the pathophysiological implications of impaired 
      ferritinophagy via functional analysis of the omics profile of HT22 cells 
      deficient in NCOA4. RESULTS: NCOA4 silencing impaired ferritin turnover and was 
      cytotoxic when cells were restricted of iron. Quantitative proteomics identified 
      IRP2 accumulation among the most prominent protein responses produced by NCOA4 
      depletion in HT22 cells, which is indicative of functional iron deficiency. 
      Additionally, proteins of apoptotic signaling pathway were enriched by those 
      responsive to NCOA4 deficiency. Transcriptome profiles of NCOA4 depletion 
      revealed neuronal cell death, differentiation of neurons, and development of 
      neurons as potential diseases and bio functions affected by impaired 
      ferritinophagy, particularly, when iron was restricted. DISCUSSION: These 
      findings identify an integral role of NCOA4-mediated ferritinophagy in the 
      maintenance of iron homeostasis by HT22 cells, and its potential implications in 
      controlling genetic pathways of neurodevelopment and neurodegenerative diseases.

TI  - Transcriptomic analysis of asthma and allergic rhinitis reveals CST1 as a 
      biomarker of unified airways.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Allergic rhinitis (AR) is an important risk factor for the 
      development of asthma. The "unified airway" theory considers the upper and lower 
      airways as a morphological and functional whole. However, studies exploring 
      biomarkers linking the upper and lower airways in allergic disease are lacking, 
      which may provide insight into the mechanisms underlying AR comorbid asthma. 
      PURPOSE: To integrate bioinformatics techniques to explore biomarkers in airway 
      allergic diseases, and to provide a molecular etiology profile for preventing the 
      development of asthma in AR patients. METHODS: Biomarkers were screened by 
      identifying key genes common between AR and asthma through WGCNA and differential 
      gene analysis. GO and KEGG analyses were performed using DAVID. 
      Immuno-infiltration analysis was performed by CIBERSORTx. The predictive value of 
      CST1 to distinguish Th2-high asthma was determined by ROC curves. GSEA was used 
      to analyze the signaling pathways involved in CST1. TargetScan and miRNet were 
      combined with GSE142237 to construct ceRNA network. CMap was used to explore 
      potential therapeutic drugs. RESULTS: Validation of datasets showed that CST1 was 
      the only gene that was up-regulated in both upper and lower airways in patients 
      with AR and asthma, and correlation heatmaps showed that CST1 was the gene with 
      the highest sum of correlation coefficients. GO and KEGG analysis demonstrated 
      that the lower airways of AR patients were mainly involved in inflammatory and 
      immune responses, similar to asthma. Immune infiltration showed that CST1 was 
      mainly positively correlated with activated CD4 memory T cells. According to the 
      ROC curve, CST1 showed excellent diagnostic efficiency for Th2-high asthma. GSEA 
      indicated that CST1 was involved in the FcϵRI signaling pathway and O-glycan 
      biosynthesis. A ceRNA network including the lncRNAs KCNQ1OT1 and NEAT1 was 
      constructed. Four drugs, including verrucarin-A, had the potential to prevent the 
      development of asthma in AR patients. In addition, corticosteroids were found to 
      downregulate CST1 expression. CONCLUSION: CST1 plays a key role in the 
      development of AR comorbid asthma and may be a biomarker for airway allergic 
      diseases. Targeted treatment of CST1 has the potential to prevent the development 
      of asthma in AR patients and deserves further study.

AB  - Prion-like domains (PrLDs) are intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) of low 
      sequence complexity with a similar composition to yeast prion domains. 
      PrLDs-containing proteins have been involved in different organisms' regulatory 
      processes. Regions of moderate amyloid propensity within IDRs have been shown to 
      assemble autonomously into amyloid fibrils. These sequences tend to be rich in 
      polar amino acids and often escape from the detection of classical bioinformatics 
      screenings that look for highly aggregation-prone hydrophobic sequence stretches. 
      We defined them as cryptic amyloidogenic regions (CARs) and recently developed an 
      integrated database that collects thousands of predicted CARs in IDRs. CARs seem 
      to be evolutionary conserved among disordered regions because of their potential 
      to stablish functional contacts with other biomolecules. Here we have focused on 
      identifying and characterizing CARs in prion-like proteins (pCARs) from plants, a 
      lineage that has been poorly studied in comparison with other prionomes. We 
      confirmed the intrinsic amyloid potential for a selected pCAR from Arabidopsis 
      thaliana and explored functional enrichments and compositional bias of pCARs in 
      plant prion-like proteins.

AB  - Alternative splicing (AS) enables differential inclusion of exons from a given 
      transcript, thereby contributing to the transcriptome and proteome diversity. 
      Aberrant AS patterns play major roles in the development of different 
      pathologies, including breast cancer. N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A), the most 
      abundant internal modification of eukaryotic mRNA, influences tumor progression 
      and metastasis of breast cancer, and it has been recently linked to AS 
      regulation. Here, we identify a specific AS signature associated with breast 
      tumorigenesis in vitro. We characterize for the first time the role of METTL3 in 
      modulating breast cancer-associated AS programs, expanding the role of the 
      m(6)A-methyltransferase in tumorigenesis. Specifically, we find that both m(6)A 
      deposition in splice site boundaries and in splicing and transcription factor 
      transcripts, such as MYC, direct AS switches of specific breast cancer-associated 
      transcripts. Finally, we show that five of the AS events validated in vitro are 
      associated with a poor overall survival rate for patients with breast cancer, 
      suggesting the use of these AS events as a novel potential prognostic biomarker.

TI  - Integrated Proteomic and Metabolomic Analyses Show Differential Effects of 
      Glucose Availability in Marine Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus.

AB  - We compared changes induced by the addition of 100 nM and 5 mM glucose on the 
      proteome and metabolome complements in Synechococcus sp. strains WH8102, WH7803, 
      and BL107 and Prochlorococcus sp. strains MED4, SS120, and MIT9313, grown either 
      under standard light conditions or in darkness. Our results suggested that 
      glucose is metabolized by these cyanobacteria, using primarily the oxidative 
      pentoses and Calvin pathways, while no proof was found for the involvement of the 
      Entner-Doudoroff pathway in this process. We observed differences in the effects 
      of glucose availability, both between genera and between Prochlorococcus MED4 and 
      SS120 strains, which might be related to their specific adaptations to the 
      environment. We found evidence for fermentation in Prochlorococcus sp. strain 
      SS120 and Synechococcus sp. strain WH8102 after 5 mM glucose addition. Our 
      results additionally suggested that marine cyanobacteria can detect nanomolar 
      glucose concentrations in the environment and that glucose might be used to 
      sustain metabolism under darkness. Furthermore, the KaiB and KaiC proteins were 
      also affected in Synechococcus sp. WH8102, pointing to a direct link between 
      glucose assimilation and circadian rhythms in marine cyanobacteria. In 
      conclusion, our study provides a wide overview on the metabolic effects induced 
      by glucose availability in representative strains of the diverse marine 
      picocyanobacteria, providing further evidence for the importance of mixotrophy in 
      marine picocyanobacteria. IMPORTANCE Glucose uptake by marine picocyanobacteria 
      has been previously described and strongly suggests they are mixotrophic 
      organisms (capable of using energy from the sun to make organic matter, but also 
      to directly use organic matter from the environment when available). However, a 
      detailed analysis of the effects of glucose addition on the proteome and 
      metabolome of these microorganisms had not been carried out. Here, we analyzed 
      three Prochlorococcus sp. and three Synechococcus sp. strains which were 
      representative of several marine picocyanobacterial clades. We observed 
      differential features in the effects of glucose availability, depending on both 
      the genus and strain; our study illuminated the strategies utilized by these 
      organisms to metabolize glucose and showed unexpected links to other pathways, 
      such as circadian regulation. Furthermore, we found glucose addition had profound 
      effects in the microbiome, favoring the growth of coexisting heterotrophic 
      bacteria.

TI  - Transcriptomic analysis provides insight into the mechanism of IKKβ-mediated 
      suppression of HPV18E6-induced cellular abnormalities.

AB  - High-risk human papillomaviruses (HPVs) 16 and 18 are responsible for more than 
      70% of cervical cancers and majority of other HPV-associated cancers world-wide. 
      Current treatments for these cancers have limited efficacy, which in turn has 
      resulted in disease recurrence and poor survival rates in advanced disease 
      stages. Hence, there is a significant need for development of novel 
      molecularly-targeted therapeutics. This can only be achieved through improved 
      understanding of disease mechanism. Recently, we developed a Drosophila model of 
      HPV18E6 plus human E3 ubiquitin ligase (hUBE3A) and demonstrated that the 
      E6-induced cellular abnormalities are conserved between humans and flies. 
      Subsequently, we demonstrated that reduced level and activity of IKKβ, a 
      regulator of NF-κB, suppresses the cellular abnormalities induced by E6 
      oncoprotein and that the interaction of IKKβ and E6 is conserved in human cells. 
      In this study, we performed transcriptomic analysis to identify differentially 
      expressed genes that play a role in IKKβ-mediated suppression of E6-induced 
      defects. Transcriptome analysis identified 215 genes whose expression was altered 
      due to reduced levels of IKKβ. Of these 215 genes, 151 genes showed annotations. 
      These analyses were followed by functional genetic interaction screen using RNAi, 
      overexpression, and mutant fly strains for identified genes. The screen 
      identified several genes including genes involved in Hippo and Toll pathways as 
      well as junctional complexes whose downregulation or upregulation resulted in 
      alterations of E6-induced defects. Subsequently, RT-PCR analysis was performed 
      for validation of altered gene expression level for a few representative genes. 
      Our results indicate an involvement for Hippo and Toll pathways in IKKβ-mediated 
      suppression of E6 + hUBE3A-induced cellular abnormalities. Therefore, this study 
      enhances our understanding of the mechanisms underlying HPV-induced cancer and 
      can potentially lead to identification of novel drug targets for cancers 
      associated with HPV.

      Transcription and RNA Splicing.

AB  - Low level HIV transcription during modern antiretroviral therapy (ART) in persons 
      with HIV is linked to residual inflammation and associated diseases, like 
      cardiovascular disease and cancer. The "block and lock" approach to hold HIV in a 
      state of deep latency may help decrease residual inflammation in a person with 
      HIV on ART and thus improve health. A camptothecin analog topotecan (TPT) was 
      previously implicated as an inhibitor of active HIV replication. Using an in 
      vitro primary T cell model of HIV latency, we demonstrated that (i) TPT reduces 
      HIV transcriptional activity in latently infected cells; (ii) downregulation of 
      HIV RNA by TPT cannot be reversed by latency reversing agents; (iii) several 
      primary and secondary mechanism of action of TPT may be involved in control of 
      HIV replication; (iv) regulation of HIV RNA by TPT is dependent on splicing 
      complexity; (v) increase in proportion of unspliced HIV transcripts was 
      facilitated by intron retention and upregulation of splicing factors, 
      specifically SRSF6, by TPT. Although high TPT dosing (10 μM) was needed to 
      achieve the observed effects, viability of primary CD4(+) T cells was not greatly 
      affected. Because toxicity can be observed with TPT in persons with cancer, TPT 
      is unlikely to be used as an anti-HIV agent in clinic, but our study provides 
      proof that camptothetin has "block and lock" activity. Other camptothetin 
      analogs, which are less toxic than TPT, should be designed and tested as HIV 
      "block and lock" agents. IMPORTANCE HIV survives in a state of very low activity, 
      called latency, for long periods in persons with HIV on antiretroviral therapy. 
      This low activity of HIV is linked to residual inflammation and associated 
      diseases, such as heart disease and cancer. New strategies are being explored to 
      further silence the HIV provirus and suppress residual inflammation. This study 
      provides strong evidence that the camptothetin analog, Topotecan, can reduce 
      residual activity of HIV in an experimental model of HIV latency. While Topotecan 
      itself is likely not suitable for use in the clinic due to its toxicity, other 
      camptothetin analogs should be designed and investigated as "block and lock" 
      agents.

AB  - Objective: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) affects almost a quarter of 
      the world's population. Although NAFLD often co-exists with obesity, a 
      substantial proportion of NAFLD patients are lean which is relatively unexplored. 
      This study aimed to examine the association between genetic variation in 
      candidate genes, e.g., TBC1D1 and the risk of lean NAFLD in the elderly Chinese 
      Han population. Methods: This is an extension of the research on physical 
      examination in the Zhanjiang community center including 5387 residents, Shanghai, 
      China, in 2017. According to the classification in adult Asian populations, 
      participants were categorized into four groups: lean NAFLD (BMI <23, n = 106), 
      non-lean NAFLD (BMI ≥23, n = 644), lean non-NAFLD (BMI <23, n = 216) and non-lean 
      non-NAFLD (BMI ≥23, n = 253).116 NAFLD-related candidate genes, which cover 179 
      single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were included in the KEGG enrichment 
      analysis. Independent samples t-test was adopted for the group comparison. The 
      associations between genetic variations with the specific phenotype in five 
      genetic models were analyzed with the "SNPassoc" R package and rechecked with 
      logistic regression analysis. Mediation models were conducted to explore whether 
      the certain phenotype can mediate the association between SNPs and the risk of 
      lean NAFLD. Results: Compared with lean non-NAFLD individuals, lean NAFLD 
      patients had higher BMI, low-density lipoprotein and triglyceride, and lower HDL. 
      The AMPK signaling pathway, which includes TBC1D1 and ADIPOQ genes, was the most 
      significant (p < .001). The A allele frequency of rs2279028 in TBC1D1 (p = .006) 
      and G allele frequency of rs17366568 in ADIPOQ (p = .038) were significantly 
      lower in lean NAFLD. The association between rs2279028 and the risk of lean NAFLD 
      was mediated by HDL (p = .014). No significant mediation effect was found between 
      rs17366568 and the risk of lean NAFLD. Conclusion: This study, for the first 
      time, indicated that rs2279028 of TBC1D1 may contribute to the progression of 
      lean NAFLD through HDL. This finding provides more evidence for exploring the 
      mechanism of lean NAFLD and suggests practical solutions for the treatment of 
      lean NAFLD.

AB  - Bacterial RNP bodies (BR-bodies) are non membrane-bound structures that 
      facilitate mRNA decay by concentrating mRNA substrates with RNase E and the 
      associated RNA degradosome machinery. However, the full complement of proteins 
      enriched in BR-bodies has not been defined. Here we define the protein substrates 
      of BR-bodies through enrichment of the bodies followed by liquid 
      chromatography-mass spec (LC-MS) proteomic analysis. We found 111 BR-body 
      enriched proteins, including many RNA binding proteins, many of which are also 
      recruited directly to in vitro reconstituted RNase E droplets, suggesting 
      BR-bodies are more complex than previously assumed. While most BR-body enriched 
      proteins cannot phase separate, we identified five which can undergo RNA 
      dependent phase separation in vitro , suggesting other RNP condensates interface 
      with BR-bodies. The RNA degradosome protein clients are recruited more strongly 
      to RNase E droplets than that of the other RNP condensates, suggesting that 
      client specificity is largely achieved through direct protein-protein 
      interactions. We observe that some RNP condensates assemble unidirectionally, 
      suggesting that RNA may be trafficked through RNP condensates in an ordered 
      manner to facilitate mRNA processing/decay, and that some BR-body associated 
      proteins have the capacity to dissolve the condensate. Finally, we find that RNA 
      dramatically stimulates the rate of RNase E phase separation in vitro , 
      explaining the observed dissolution of BR-bodies after cellular mRNA depletion 
      observed previously. Altogether, these results suggest that a complex network of 
      protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions controls BR-body phase separation 
      while coordinating this mode of organization with RNA processing. HIGHLIGHTS: 
      BR-body proteomics identified 111 proteins enriched in BR-bodies.BR-bodies 
      associate with an interconnected network of RNP condensates.BR-body condensation 
      is modulated by its interaction network.RNA is required for rapid BR-body 
      condensation.

AB  - The persistent environmental aryl hydrocarbon receptor agonist and hepatotoxin 
      TCDD (2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo- p -dioxin) induces hepatic lipid accumulation 
      (steatosis), inflammation (steatohepatitis) and fibrosis. Thousands of 
      liver-expressed, nuclear-localized lncRNAs with regulatory potential have been 
      identified; however, their roles in TCDD-induced hepatoxicity and liver disease 
      are unknown. We analyzed single nucleus (sn)RNA-seq data from control and chronic 
      TCDD-exposed mouse liver to determine liver cell-type specificity, zonation and 
      differential expression profiles for thousands of IncRNAs. TCDD dysregulated 
      >4,000 of these lncRNAs in one or more liver cell types, including 684 lncRNAs 
      specifically dysregulated in liver non-parenchymal cells. Trajectory inference 
      analysis revealed major disruption by TCDD of hepatocyte zonation, affecting >800 
      genes, including 121 IncRNAs, with strong enrichment for lipid metabolism genes. 
      TCDD also dysregulated expression of >200 transcription factors, including 19 
      Nuclear Receptors, most notably in hepatocytes and Kupffer cells. TCDD-induced 
      changes in cellâ€"cell communication patterns included marked decreases in EGF 
      signaling from hepatocytes to non-parenchymal cells and increases in 
      extracellular matrix-receptor interactions central to liver fibrosis. Gene 
      regulatory networks constructed from the snRNA-seq data identified TCDD-exposed 
      liver network-essential lncRNA regulators linked to functions such as fatty acid 
      metabolic process, peroxisome and xenobiotic metabolic. Networks were validated 
      by the striking enrichments that predicted regulatory IncRNAs showed for specific 
      biological pathways. These findings highlight the power of snRNA-seq to discover 
      functional roles for many xenobiotic-responsive lncRNAs in both hepatocytes and 
      liver non-parenchymal cells and to elucidate novel aspects of foreign 
      chemical-induced hepatotoxicity and liver disease, including dysregulation of 
      intercellular communication within the liver lobule.

AB  - Genomic and transcriptomic data have been generated across a wide range of 
      prostate cancer (PCa) study cohorts. These data can be used to better 
      characterize the molecular features associated with clinical outcomes and to test 
      hypotheses across multiple, independent patient cohorts. In addition, derived 
      features, such as estimates of cell composition, risk scores, and androgen 
      receptor (AR) scores, can be used to develop novel hypotheses leveraging existing 
      multi-omic datasets. The full potential of such data is yet to be realized as 
      independent datasets exist in different repositories, have been processed using 
      different pipelines, and derived and clinical features are often not provided or 
      unstandardized. Here, we present the curatedPCaData R package, a harmonized data 
      resource representing >2900 primary tumor, >200 normal tissue, and >500 
      metastatic PCa samples across 19 datasets processed using standardized pipelines 
      with updated gene annotations. We show that meta-analysis across harmonized 
      studies has great potential for robust and clinically meaningful insights. 
      curatedPCaData is an open and accessible community resource with code made 
      available for reproducibility.

TI  - The neurodevelopmental transcriptome of the Drosophila melanogaster microcephaly 
      gene abnormal spindle reveals a role for temporal transcription factors and the 
      immune system in regulating brain size.
LID - 2023.01.09.523369 [pii]
LID - 10.1101/2023.01.09.523369 [doi]
AB  - The coordination of cellular behaviors during neurodevelopment is critical for 
      determining the form, function, and size of the central nervous system. Mutations 
      in the vertebrate Abnormal Spindle-Like, Microcephaly Associated (ASPM) gene and 
      its Drosophila melanogaster ortholog abnormal spindle (asp) lead to microcephaly, 
      a reduction in overall brain size whose etiology remains poorly defined. Here we 
      provide the neurodevelopmental transcriptional landscape for a Drosophila model 
      for autosomal recessive primary microcephaly (MCPH) and extend our findings into 
      the functional realm in an attempt to identify the key cellular mechanisms 
      responsible for Asp-dependent brain growth and development. We identify multiple 
      transcriptomic signatures, including new patterns of co-expressed genes in the 
      developing CNS. Defects in optic lobe neurogenesis were detected in larval brains 
      through downregulation of temporal transcription factors (tTFs) and Notch 
      signaling targets, which correlated with a significant reduction in brain size 
      and total cell numbers during the neurogenic window of development. We also found 
      inflammation as a hallmark of asp MCPH brains, detectable throughout every stage 
      of CNS development, which also contributes to the brain size phenotype. Finally, 
      we show that apoptosis is not a primary driver of the asp MCPH phenotype, further 
      highlighting an intrinsic Asp-dependent neurogenesis promotion mechanism that is 
      independent of cell death. Collectively, our results suggest that the etiology of 
      asp MCPH is complex and that a comprehensive view of the cellular basis of the 
      disorder requires an understanding of how multiple pathway inputs collectively 
      determine the microcephaly phenotype. AUTHOR SUMMARY: Autosomal recessive primary 
      microcephaly (MCPH) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by a reduction 
      in brain size, intellect, and life span. Over 30 genes have been found mutated in 
      human MCPH patients, with Abnormal Spindle-Like, Microcephaly Associated (ASPM) 
      being the most common. Although the clinical aspects of the disorder are 
      well-characterized, the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms are not. The 
      fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, has an ortholog of the ASPM gene named 
      abnormal spindle (asp), and mutations also give rise to fruit flies with small 
      brains. It had previously been suggested that mitotic spindle defects were 
      responsible for the asp MCPH phenotype, preventing neural stem cells from 
      dividing properly to generate the necessary number of neurons and glia in the 
      brain. However, genetic studies in flies showed that this wasnâ€™t the case, 
      suggesting that our knowledge of MCPH remains incomplete and must be revised. In 
      this manuscript, we identified new pathways important for asp- dependent brain 
      growth through transcriptional profiling. We found a number of key pathways 
      disrupted in asp mutants, which have not been described previously. Using genetic 
      tools in the fly, we tested a subset of these pathways to identify their 
      contributions to the brain growth defects seen in asp mutants. Our results add to 
      the growing number of pathways necessary for brain growth control, and provide a 
      suitable foundation for follow-up genetic studies to assess MCPH.

AB  - Family with sequence similarity of 83D (FAM83D) is overexpressed in various 
      cancers. However, no pan-cancer analysis is presently available. In the present 
      study, we used a bioinformatics analysis to explore the diagnostic and prognostic 
      value of FAM83D expression levels in human cancers. The GEPIA 2, TIMER 2.0, 
      ENCORI, and DriverDBV3 databases were used to evaluate FAM83D expression levels. 
      The potential prognostic value of FAM83D expression was analyzed using the GEPIA 
      2, UALCAN, and TISIB databases. The driver gene and promoter methylation levels 
      regarding FAM83D were evaluated using the TIMER 2.0 and UALCAN databases. To 
      further analyze interactive networks for FAM83D, FAM83D-binding proteins and 
      related genes were determined using STRING and Gene MANIA analytic tools. Highly 
      expressed FAM83D could be associated with mutated TP53 and promoter DNA 
      methylation. Relative network analysis suggested that FAM83D was mainly involved 
      in the progesterone-mediated oocyte maturation pathway, cell cycle regulation, 
      and several other signaling pathways. Therefore, the differential expression of 
      FAM83D could serve as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for various cancers. 
      Our study revealed useful information about the differential expression of 
      FAM83D, prognostic values, and potential functional networks in a variety of 
      cancers, providing valuable substantive and methodological information to explore 
      the underlying mechanisms.Abbreviations: BP: Biological processes; CC: Cellular

AB  - Resistant starches (RS) are fermented in the cecum and colon to produce 
      short-chain fatty acids and other microbial metabolites that can alter host 
      physiology and the composition of the microbiome. We previously showed that mice 
      fed a Total Western Diet (TWD) based on NHANES data that mimics the composition 
      of a typical American diet, containing resistant potato starch (RPS), produced 
      concentration dependent changes to the cecal short-chain fatty acids, the 
      microbiome composition as well as gene expression changes in the cecum and colon 
      that were most prevalent in mice fed the 10% RPS diet. We were then interested in 
      whether feeding TWD/RPS would alter the resistance to bacterial-induced colitis 
      caused by Citrobacter rodentium (Cr), a mouse pathogen that shares 66.7% of 
      encoded genes with Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli. Mice were fed the TWD for 6 
      weeks followed by a 3-weeks on the RPS diets before infecting with Cr. Fecal Cr 
      excretion was monitored over time and fecal samples were collected for 16S 
      sequencing. Mice were euthanized on day 12 post-infection and cecal contents 
      collected for 16S sequencing. Cecum and colon tissues were obtained for gene 
      expression analysis, histology and to determine the level of mucosa-associated 
      Cr. Feeding RPS increased the percentage of mice productively infected by Cr and 
      fecal Cr excretion on day 4 post-infection. Mice fed the TWD/10% RPS diet also 
      had greater colonization of colonic tissue at day 12 post-infection and colonic 
      pathology. Both diet and infection altered the fecal and cecal microbiome 
      composition with increased levels of RPS resulting in decreased α-diversity that 
      was partially reversed by Cr infection. RNASeq analysis identified several 
      mechanistic pathways that could be associated with the increased colonization of 
      Cr-infected mice fed 10% RPS. In the distal colon we found a decrease in 
      enrichment for genes associated with T cells, B cells, genes associated with the 
      synthesis of DHA-derived SPMs and VA metabolism/retinoic acid signaling. We also 
      found an increase in the expression of the potentially immunosuppressive gene, 
      Ido1. These results suggest that high-level consumption of RPS in the context of 
      a typical American diet, may alter susceptibility to gastrointestinal bacterial 
      infections.

AB  - Chaperonin containing TCP1 subunit 2 (CCT2) is essential in various 
      neurodegenerative diseases, albeit its role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's 
      disease (AD) remains elusive. This study aimed to evaluate the role of CCT2 in 
      Alzheimer's disease. First, bioinformatics database analysis revealed that CCT2 
      was significantly downregulated in patients with Alzheimer's disease and 
      associated with autophagic clearance of β-amyloid. The 789 differentially 
      expressed genes overlapped in AD-group and CCT2-low/high group, and the 
      CCT2-high-associated genes screened by Pearson coefficients were enriched in 
      protein folding, autophagy, and messenger RNA stability regulation pathways. 
      These results suggest that CCT2 is significantly and positively associated with 
      multiple pathways linked to autophagy and negatively associated with neuronal 
      death. The logistic prediction model with 13 key genes, such as CCT2, screened in 
      this study better predicts Alzheimer's disease occurrence (AUC = 0.9671) and is a 
      favorable candidate for predicting potential biological targets of Alzheimer's 
      disease. Additionally, this study predicts reciprocal micro RNAs and small 
      molecule drugs for hub genes. Our findings suggest that low CCT2 expression may 
      be responsible for the autophagy suppression in Alzheimer's disease, providing an 
      accurate explanation for its pathogenesis and new targets and small molecule 
      inhibitors for its treatment.

AB  - Background: Individualized recurrence risk prediction in patients with stage 
      II/III colorectal cancer (CRC) is crucial for making postoperative treatment 
      decisions. However, there is still a lack of effective approaches for identifying 
      patients with stage II and III CRC at a high risk of recurrence. In this study, 
      we aimed to establish a credible gene model for improving the risk assessment of 
      patients with stage II/III CRC. Methods: Recurrence-free survival (RFS)-related 
      genes were screened using Univariate Cox regression analysis in GSE17538, 
      GSE39582, and GSE161158 cohorts. Common prognostic genes were identified by Venn 
      diagram and subsequently subjected to least absolute shrinkage and selection 
      operator (LASSO) regression analysis and multivariate Cox regression analysis for 
      signature construction. Kaplan-Meier (K-M), calibration, and receiver operating 
      characteristic (ROC) curves were used to assess the predictive accuracy and 
      superiority of our risk model. Single-sample gene set enrichment analysis 
      (ssGSEA) was employed to investigate the relationship between the infiltrative 
      abundances of immune cells and risk scores. Genes significantly associated with 
      the risk scores were identified to explore the biological implications of the 
      9-gene signature. Results: Survival analysis identified 347 RFS-related genes. 
      Using these genes, a 9-gene signature was constructed, which was composed of 
      MRPL41, FGD3, RBM38, SPINK1, DKK1, GAL3ST4, INHBB, CTB-113P19.1, and FAM214B. K-M 
      curves verified the survival differences between the low- and high-risk groups 
      classified by the 9-gene signature. The area under the curve (AUC) values of this 
      signature were close to or no less than the previously reported prognostic 
      signatures and clinical factors, suggesting that this model could provide 
      improved RFS prediction. The ssGSEA algorithm estimated that eight immune cells, 
      including regulatory T cells, were aberrantly infiltrated in the high-risk group. 
      Furthermore, the signature was associated with multiple oncogenic pathways, 
      including cell adhesion and angiogenesis. Conclusion: A novel RFS prediction 
      model for patients with stage II/III CRC was constructed using multicohort 
      validation. The proposed signature may help clinicians better manage patients 
      with stage II/III CRC.

TI  - Study on the molecular mechanism of anti-liver cancer effect of Evodiae fructus 
      by network pharmacology and QSAR model.

AB  - Introduction: Evodiae Fructus (EF) is the dried, near ripe fruit of Euodia 
      rutaecarpa (Juss.) Benth in Rutaceae. Numerous studies have demonstrated its 
      anti-liver cancer properties. However, the molecular mechanism of Evodiae fructus 
      against liver cancer and its structure-activity connection still require 
      clarification. Methods: We utilized network pharmacology and a QSAR (2- and 
      3-dimensional) model to study the anti-liver cancer effect of Evodiae fructus. 
      First, by using network pharmacology to screen the active substances and targets 
      of Evodiae fructus, we investigated the signaling pathways involved in the 
      anti-liver cancer actions of Evodiae fructus. The 2D-QSAR pharmacophore model was 
      then used to predict the pIC50 values of compounds. The hiphop method was used to 
      create an ideal 3D-QSAR pharmacophore model for the prediction of Evodiae fructus 
      compounds. Finally, molecular docking was used to validate the rationality of the 
      pharmacophore, and molecular dynamics was used to disclose the stability of the 
      compounds by assessing the trajectories in 10 ns using RMSD, RMSF, Rg, and 
      hydrogen bonding metrics. Results: In total, 27 compounds were acquired from the 
      TCMSP and TCM-ID databases, and 45 intersection targets were compiled using Venn 
      diagrams. Network integration analysis was used in this study to identify SRC as 
      a primary target. Key pathways were discovered by KEGG pathway analysis, 
      including PD-L1 expression and PD-1 checkpoint pathway, EGFR tyrosine kinase 
      inhibitor resistance, and ErbB signaling pathway. Using a 2D-QSAR pharmacophore 
      model and the MLR approach to predict chemical activity, ten highly active 
      compounds were found. Two hydrophobic features and one hydrogen bond acceptor 
      feature in the 3D-QSAR pharmacophore model were validated by training set 
      chemicals. The results of molecular docking revealed that 10 active compounds had 
      better docking scores with SRC and were linked to residues via hydrogen and 
      hydrophobic bonds. Molecular dynamics was used to show the structural stability 
      of obacunone, beta-sitosterol, and sitosterol. Conclusion:Pharmacophore 01 has 
      high selectivity and the ability to distinguish active and inactive compounds, 
      which is the optimal model for this study. Obacunone has the optimal binding 
      ability with SRC. The pharmacophore model proposed in this study provides 
      theoretical support for further screening effective anti-cancer Chinese herbal 
      compounds and optimizing the compound structure.

AB  - N-glycosylation is a key process for various biological functions like protein 
      folding, maturation and sorting for the conventional secretory compartment, 
      cell-cell communication and immune response. This is usually accomplished by a 
      complex system of mannosidases in which those from class I have an outstanding 
      role, commonly involved in the early protein sorting associated to the 
      Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) in the N-glycan dependent quality control (ERQC) and 
      ER-associated degradation (ERAD). Although these are vital processes in 
      maintaining cellular homeostasis, large-scale analysis studies for this pool of 
      molecules, further denoted as proteins from the early secretory pathway (ESP), 
      were limited addressed. Here, using a custom workflow employing a combination of 
      glycomics and deglycoproteomics analyses, using lectin affinity and selective 
      Endoglycosidase H (Endo H) digestion, we scrutinize the steady-state 
      oligomannosidic glycoprotein load and delineate ESP fraction in melanoma cells. 
      All of these were assessed by applying our workflow for glycosite relative 
      quantification of both the peptide chain and carbohydrate structure in cells with 
      inhibited activity of class I mannosidases after kifunensine treatment. We found 
      that most of the ESP are transient clients involved in cell communication via 
      extracellular matrix, particularly integrin-mediated communication which adopt 
      Man9 N-glycans in kifunensine-treated cells. Moreover, our results reveal that 
      core-fucosylation is decreased subsequent inhibition of class I mannosidases and 
      this could be explained by a general lower protein level of FUT8, the enzyme 
      responsible for fucosylation. By comparing our data with results obtained 
      following downregulation of a key mannosidase in misfolded protein degradation, 
      we mapped both novel and previously suggested endogenous substrate candidates 
      like PCDH2, HLA-B, LAMB2 or members of the integrin family of proteins such as 
      ITGA1 and ITGA4, thus validating the findings obtained using our workflow 
      regarding accumulation and characterization of ESP transitory members following 
      mannosidase class I inhibition. This workflow and the associated dataset not only 
      allowed us to investigate the oligomannosidic glycoprotein fraction but also to 
      delineate differences mediated at glycosite-level upon kifunensine treatment and 
      outline the potential associated cellular responses.

TI  - ADAD2 functions in spermiogenesis and piRNA biogenesis in mice.
PG  - 698-709
LID - 10.1111/andr.13400 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Adenosine deaminase domain containing 2 (ADAD2) is a testis-specific 
      protein composed of a double-stranded RNA binding domain and a non-catalytic 
      adenosine deaminase domain. A recent study showed that ADAD2 is indispensable for 
      the male reproduction in mice. However, the detailed functions of ADAD2 remain 
      elusive. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate the cause of male sterility 
      in Adad2 mutant mice and to understand the molecular functions of ADAD2. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Adad2 homozygous mutant mouse lines, Adad2(-/-) and 
      Adad2(Δ/Δ) , were generated by CRISPR/Cas9. Western blotting and 
      immunohistochemistry were used to reveal the expression and subcellular 
      localization of ADAD2. Co-immunoprecipitation tandem mass spectrometry was 
      employed to determine the ADAD2-interacting proteins in mouse testes. 
      RNA-sequencing analyses were carried out to analyze the transcriptome and 
      PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA) populations in wildtype and Adad2 mutant testes. 
      RESULTS: Adad2(-/-) and Adad2(Δ/Δ) mice exhibit male-specific sterility because 
      of abnormal spermiogenesis. ADAD2 interacts with multiple RNA-binding proteins 
      involved in piRNA biogenesis, including MILI, MIWI, RNF17, and YTHDC2. ADAD2 
      co-localizes and forms novel granules with RNF17 in spermatocytes. Ablation of 
      ADAD2 impairs the formation of RNF17 granules, decreases the number of 
      cluster-derived pachytene piRNAs, and increases expression of ping-pong-derived 
      piRNAs. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: In collaboration with RNF17 and other 
      RNA-binding proteins in spermatocytes, ADAD2 directly or indirectly functions in 
      piRNA biogenesis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder that is usually diagnosed in 
      early childhood. Timely diagnosis and early initiation of treatments such as 
      behavioral therapy are important in autistic people. Discovering critical genes 
      and regulators in this disorder can lead to early diagnosis. Since the 
      contribution of miRNAs along their targets can lead us to a better understanding 
      of autism, we propose a framework containing two steps for gene and miRNA 
      discovery. METHODS: The first step, called the FA_gene algorithm, finds a small 
      set of genes involved in autism. This algorithm uses the WGCNA package to 
      construct a co-expression network for control samples and seek modules of genes 
      that are not reproducible in the corresponding co-expression network for autistic 
      samples. Then, the protein-protein interaction network is constructed for genes 
      in the non-reproducible modules and a small set of genes that may have potential 
      roles in autism is selected based on this network. The second step, named the 
      DMN_miRNA algorithm, detects the minimum number of miRNAs related to autism. To 
      do this, DMN_miRNA defines an extended Set Cover algorithm over the mRNA-miRNA 
      network, consisting of the selected genes and corresponding miRNA regulators. 
      RESULTS: In the first step of the framework, the FA_gene algorithm finds a set of 
      important genes; TP53, TNF, MAPK3, ACTB, TLR7, LCK, RAC2, EEF2, CAT, ZAP70, CD19, 
      RPLP0, CDKN1A, CCL2, CDK4, CCL5, CTSD, CD4, RACK1, CD74; using co-expression and 
      protein-protein interaction networks. In the second step, the DMN_miRNA algorithm 
      extracts critical miRNAs, hsa-mir-155-5p, hsa-mir-17-5p, hsa-mir-181a-5p, 
      hsa-mir-18a-5p, and hsa-mir-92a-1-5p, as signature regulators for autism using 
      important genes and mRNA-miRNA network. The importance of these key genes and 
      miRNAs is confirmed by previous studies and enrichment analysis. CONCLUSION: This 
      study suggests FA_gene and DMN_miRNA algorithms for biomarker discovery, which 
      lead us to a list of important players in ASD with potential roles in the nervous 
      system or neurological disorders that can be experimentally investigated as 
      candidates for ASD diagnostic tests.

AB  - Exploring wild reservoirs of pathogenic viruses is critical for their long-term 
      control and for predicting future pandemic scenarios. Here, a comparative in 
      vitro infection analysis was first performed on 83 cell cultures derived from 55 
      mammalian species using pseudotyped viruses bearing S proteins from SARS-CoV-2, 
      SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV. Cell cultures from Thomas's horseshoe bats, king 
      horseshoe bats, green monkeys, and ferrets were found to be highly susceptible to 
      SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV pseudotyped viruses. Moreover, five variants 
      (del69-70, D80Y, S98F, T572I, and Q675H), that beside spike receptor-binding 
      domain can significantly alter the host tropism of SARS-CoV-2. An examination of 
      phylogenetic signals of transduction rates revealed that closely related taxa 
      generally have similar susceptibility to MERS-CoV but not to SARS-CoV and 
      SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped viruses. Additionally, we discovered that the expression 
      of 95 genes, e.g., PZDK1 and APOBEC3, were commonly associated with the 
      transduction rates of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped viruses. 
      This study provides basic documentation of the susceptibility, variants, and 
      molecules that underlie the cross-species transmission of these coronaviruses.

AB  - Myrrh is the dried resin of Commiphora Myrrh Engl., which exerts anticancer 
      properties. However, its effects and molecular mechanisms in triple-negative 
      breast cancer (TNBC) remain unclear. In this study, we used network pharmacology 
      to screen Z-Guggulsterone (Z-GS) as a characteristic active component of myrrh. 
      Cell Counting Kit-8 proliferation assays showed that Z-GS inhibited proliferation 
      of the TNBC cell lines MDA-MB-468 and BT-549. Transwell assays also showed that 
      Z-GS inhibited TNBC migration and invasion phenotypes. Our network pharmacology 
      combined with RNA-sequencing analyses showed that Z-GS affected cell cycle and 
      apoptosis processes in TNBC cells, mainly via p53 signaling, to regulate key 
      CCNB1 (cyclin B1), PLK1 (polo-like kinase 1), and p53 targets. Flow cytometry 
      revealed that Z-GS arrested the cell cycle at the G2/M phase and increased 
      apoptosis in TNBC cells. Western blotting and quantitative real-time polymerase 
      chain reaction studies confirmed that Z-GS functioned via the p53-mediated 
      downregulation of CCNB1 and PLK1 expression. In vivo studies showed that Z-GS 
      effectively inhibited TNBC progression. Collectively, Z-GS exhibited potential 
      anti-TNBC activity and may functions via the p53/CCNB1/PLK1 pathway.

AB  - BACKGROUNDS: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a common diabetic ocular disease 
      characterized by retinal ganglion cell (RGC) changes. An abnormal environment, 
      hyperglycemia, may progressively alter the structure and function of RGCs, which 
      is a primary pathological feature of retinal neurodegeneration in DR. Accumulated 
      studies confirmed autophagy and senescence play a vital role in DR; however, the 
      underlying mechanisms need to be clarified. METHODS: This study included the 
      microarray expression profiling dataset GSE60436 from Gene Expression Omnibus 
      (GEO) to conduct the bioinformatics analysis. The R software was used to identify 
      autophagy-related genes (ARGs) that were differentially expressed in 
      fibrovascular membranes (FVMs) and normal retinas. Co-expression and 
      tissue-specific expression were elicited for the filtered genes. The genes were 
      then analyzed by ontology (GO) enrichment analysis, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes 
      and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis 
      (GSEA). R28 cells were cultured with high glucose, detected by reverse 
      transcription-quantitative (RT-qPCR) and stained by apoptosis kit. RESULTS: In 
      the retina, 31 differentially expressed ARGs (24 up-regulated genes) were 
      discovered and enriched. The enrichment results revealed that differentially 
      expressed ARGs were significantly enriched in autophagy, apoptosis, aging, and 
      neural function. Four hub genes (i.e., TP53, CASP1, CCL2, and CASP1) were 
      significantly up-regulated. Upregulation of cellular autophagy and apoptosis 
      level was detected in the hyperglycemia model in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: Our results 
      provide evidence for the autophagy and cellular senescence mechanisms involved in 
      retinal hyperglycemia injury, and the protective function of autophagy is 
      limited. Further study may favour understanding the disease progression and 
      neuroprotection of DR.

AB  - We profile genome-wide histone 3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac) of 3 major brain 
      cell types from hippocampus and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) of 
      subjects with and without Alzheimer's Disease (AD). We confirm that single 
      nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with late onset AD (LOAD) show a 
      strong tendency to reside in microglia-specific gene regulatory elements. Despite 
      this significant colocalization, we find that microglia harbor more acetylation 
      changes associated with age than with amyloid-β (Aβ) load. In contrast, we detect 
      that an oligodendrocyte-enriched glial (OEG) population contains the majority of 
      differentially acetylated peaks associated with Aβ load. These differential peaks 
      reside near both early onset risk genes (APP, PSEN1, PSEN2) and late onset AD 
      risk loci (including BIN1, PICALM, CLU, ADAM10, ADAMTS4, SORL1, FERMT2), Aβ 
      processing genes (BACE1), as well as genes involved in myelinating and 
      oligodendrocyte development processes. Interestingly, a number of LOAD risk loci 
      associated with differentially acetylated risk genes contain H3K27ac peaks that 
      are specifically enriched in OEG. These findings implicate oligodendrocyte gene 
      regulation as a potential mechanism by which early onset and late onset risk 
      genes mediate their effects, and highlight the deregulation of myelinating 
      processes in AD. More broadly, our dataset serves as a resource for the study of 
      functional effects of genetic variants and cell type specific gene regulation in 
      AD.

TI  - Adaptive Evolution Compensated for the Plasmid Fitness Costs Brought by Specific 
      Genetic Conflicts.
LID - 10.3390/pathogens12010137 [doi]
LID - 137
AB  - New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase (NDM)-carrying IncX3 plasmids is important in the 
      transmission of carbapenem resistance in Escherichia coli. Fitness costs related 
      to plasmid carriage are expected to limit gene exchange; however, the causes of 
      these fitness costs are poorly understood. Compensatory mutations are believed to 
      ameliorate plasmid fitness costs and enable the plasmid's wide spread, suggesting 
      that such costs are caused by specific plasmid-host genetic conflicts. By 
      combining conjugation tests and experimental evolution with comparative genetic 
      analysis, we showed here that the fitness costs related to ndm/IncX3 plasmids in 
      E. coli C600 are caused by co-mutations of multiple host chromosomal genes 
      related to sugar metabolism and cell membrane function. Adaptive evolution 
      revealed that mutations in genes associated with oxidative stress, nucleotide and 
      short-chain fatty acid metabolism, and cell membranes ameliorated the costs 
      associated with plasmid carriage. Specific genetic conflicts associated with the 
      ndm/IncX3 plasmid in E. coli C600 involve metabolism and cell-membrane-related 
      genes, which could be ameliorated by compensatory mutations. Collectively, our 
      findings could explain the wide spread of IncX3 plasmids in bacterial genomes, 
      despite their potential cost.

AB  - Nutrition affects the early stages of disease development, but the mechanisms 
      remain poorly understood. High-throughput proteomic methods are being used to 
      generate data and information on the effects of nutrients, foods, and diets on 
      health and disease processes. In this report, a novel machine reading pipeline 
      was used to identify all articles and abstracts on proteomics, diet, food, and 
      nutrition in humans. The resulting proteomic corpus was further analyzed to 
      produce seven clusters of "thematic" content defined as documents that have 
      similar word content. Examples of publications from several of these clusters 
      were then described in a similar way to a typical descriptive review.

TI  - Genomic Regions Associated with Wool, Growth and Reproduction Traits in Uruguayan 
      Merino Sheep.
LID - 10.3390/genes14010167 [doi]
LID - 167
AB  - The aim of this study was to identify genomic regions and genes associated with 
      the fiber diameter (FD), clean fleece weight (CFW), live weight (LW), body 
      condition score (BCS), pregnancy rate (PR) and lambing potential (LP) of 
      Uruguayan Merino sheep. Phenotypic records of approximately 2000 mixed-age ewes 
      were obtained from a Merino nucleus flock. Genome-wide association studies were 
      performed utilizing single-step Bayesian analysis. For wool traits, a total of 35 
      genomic windows surpassed the significance threshold (PVE ≥ 0.25%). The 
      proportion of the total additive genetic variance explained by those windows was 
      4.85 and 9.06% for FD and CFW, respectively. There were 42 windows significantly 
      associated with LWM, which collectively explained 43.2% of the additive genetic 
      variance. For BCS, 22 relevant windows accounted for more than 40% of the 
      additive genetic variance, whereas for the reproduction traits, 53 genomic 
      windows (24 and 29 for PR and LP, respectively) reached the suggestive threshold 
      of 0.25% of the PVE. Within the top 10 windows for each trait, we identified 
      several genes showing potential associations with the wool (e.g., IGF-1, TGFB2R, 
      PRKCA), live weight (e.g., CAST, LAP3, MED28, HERC6), body condition score (e.g., 
      CDH10, TMC2, SIRPA, CPXM1) or reproduction traits (e.g., ADCY1, LEPR, GHR, LPAR2) 
      of the mixed-age ewes.

TI  - Andrographis Reverses Gemcitabine Resistance through Regulation of ERBB3 and 
      Calcium Signaling Pathway in Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma.
LID - 10.3390/biomedicines11010119 [doi]
LID - 119
AB  - Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most lethal malignancies, 
      primarily due to intrinsic or acquired resistance to chemotherapy, such as 
      Gemcitabine (Gem). Naturally occurring botanicals, including Andrographis 
      (Andro), can help enhance the anti-tumorigenic therapeutic efficacy of 
      conventional chemotherapy through time-tested safety and cost-effectiveness. 
      Accordingly, we hypothesized that Andro might reverse Gem resistance in PDAC. The 
      critical regulatory pathways associated with Gem resistance in PDAC were 
      identified by analyzing publicly available transcriptomic profiling and PDAC 
      tissue specimens. A series of systematic in vitro experiments were performed 
      using Gem-resistant (Gem-R) PDAC cells and patient-derived 3D-organoids to 
      evaluate the Andro-mediated reversal of Gem resistance in PDAC. Transcriptomic 
      profiling identified the calcium signaling pathway as a critical regulator of 
      Gem-resistance (Fold enrichment: 2.8, p = 0.002). Within this pathway, high ERBB3 
      expression was significantly associated with poor prognosis in PDAC patients. The 
      combination of Andro and Gem exhibited superior anti-cancer potential in Gem-R 
      PDAC cells through potentiating cellular apoptosis. The combined treatment 
      down-regulated ERBB3 and decreased intracellular calcium concentration in Gem-R 
      PDAC cells. Finally, these findings were successfully interrogated in 
      patient-derived 3D-organoids. In conclusion, we demonstrate novel evidence for 
      Andro-mediated reversal of chemoresistance to Gem in PDAC cells through the 
      regulation of ERBB3 and calcium signaling.

AB  - The qualitative and quantitative evaluation of proteome changes that condition 
      cancer development can be achieved with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry 
      (LC-MS). LC-MS-based proteomics strategies are carried out according to 
      predesigned workflows that comprise several steps such as sample selection, 
      sample processing including labeling, MS acquisition methods, statistical 
      treatment, and bioinformatics to understand the biological meaning of the 
      findings and set predictive classifiers. As the choice of best options might not 
      be straightforward, we herein review and assess past and current proteomics 
      approaches for the discovery of new cancer biomarkers. Moreover, we review major 
      bioinformatics tools for interpreting and visualizing proteomics results and 
      suggest the most popular machine learning techniques for the selection of 
      predictive biomarkers. Finally, we consider the approximation of proteomics 
      strategies for clinical diagnosis and prognosis by discussing current barriers 
      and proposals to circumvent them.

AB  - The transcriptomic analysis of microarray and RNA-Seq datasets followed our own 
      bioinformatic pipeline to identify a transcriptional regulatory network of lung 
      cancer. Twenty-six transcription factors are dysregulated and co-expressed in 
      most of the lung cancer and pulmonary arterial hypertension datasets, which makes 
      them the most frequently dysregulated transcription factors. Co-expression, gene 
      regulatory, coregulatory, and transcriptional regulatory networks, along with 
      fibration symmetries, were constructed to identify common connection patterns, 
      alignments, main regulators, and target genes in order to analyze transcription 
      factor complex formation, as well as its synchronized co-expression patterns in 
      every type of lung cancer. The regulatory function of the most frequently 
      dysregulated transcription factors over lung cancer deregulated genes was 
      validated with ChEA3 enrichment analysis. A Kaplan-Meier plotter analysis linked 
      the dysregulation of the top transcription factors with lung cancer patients' 
      survival. Our results indicate that lung cancer has unique and common deregulated 
      genes and transcription factors with pulmonary arterial hypertension, 
      co-expressed and regulated in a coordinated and cooperative manner by the 
      transcriptional regulatory network that might be associated with critical 
      biological processes and signaling pathways related to the acquisition of the 
      hallmarks of cancer, making them potentially relevant tumor biomarkers for lung 
      cancer early diagnosis and targets for the development of personalized therapies 
      against lung cancer.

LID - 10.3390/cimb45010016 [doi]
AB  - Virus infestation can seriously harm the host plant's growth and development. 
      Turnip yellows virus (TuYV) infestation of host plants can cause symptoms, such 
      as yellowing and curling of leaves and root chlorosis. However, the regulatory 
      mechanisms by which TuYV affects host growth and development are unclear. Hence, 
      it is essential to mine small RNA (sRNA) and explore the regulation of sRNAs on 
      plant hosts for disease control. In this study, we analyzed high-throughput data 
      before and after TuYV infestation in Arabidopsis using combined genetics, 
      statistics, and machine learning to identify 108 specifically expressed and 
      critical functional sRNAs after TuYV infection. First, comparing the expression 
      levels of sRNAs before and after infestation, 508 specific sRNAs were 
      significantly up-regulated in Arabidopsis after infestation. In addition, the 
      results show that AI models, including SVM, RF, XGBoost, and CNN using 
      two-dimensional convolution, have robust classification features at the sequence 
      level, with a prediction accuracy of about 96.8%. A comparison of specific sRNAs 
      with genome sequences revealed that 247 matched precisely with the TuYV genome 
      sequence but not with the Arabidopsis genome, suggesting that TuYV viruses may be 
      their source. The 247 sRNAs predicted target genes and enrichment analysis, which 
      identified 206 Arabidopsis genes involved in nine biological processes and three 
      KEGG pathways associated with plant growth and viral stress tolerance, 
      corresponding to 108 sRNAs. These findings provide a reference for studying 
      sRNA-mediated interactions in pathogen infection and are essential for 
      establishing a vital resource of regulation network for the virus infecting 
      plants and deepening the understanding of TuYV virus infection patterns. However, 
      further validation of these sRNAs is needed to gain a new understanding.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To use network pharmacology to explore the mechanism of the drug pair 
      Rhubarb-Coptis in the treatment of diabetic nephropathy (DN). METHODS: The 
      Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology (TCMSP) database was used to 
      screen active ingredients of drug pair Rhubarb-Coptis. Targets were obtained 
      using the TCMSP and SwissTargetPrediction databases. DN disease targets were 
      extracted from the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM), GeneCards, and 
      Therapeutic Target database (TTD) databases. A "drug-compound-target" network and 
      protein-protein interaction (PPI) network were constructed and analyzed through 
      the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins (STRING) database 
      and Cytoscape software. Gene Ontology (GO) functional and Kyoto Encyclopedia of 
      Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses were performed in the 
      Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) 
      database. Molecular docking was performed using AutoDock Vina and PyMOL software. 
      RESULTS: A total of 30 active components and 609 targets of Rhubarb-Coptis were 
      screened out, and 98 common targets of DN and Rhubarb-Coptis were obtained. 
      Quercetin, berberine, epiruberine, epautin, and moupinamide were the main active 
      components in the treatment of DN. The STAT3, CTNNB1, PIK3R1, PIK3CA, and TP53 
      genes were identified as the potential 5 key targets. The GO enrichment analysis 
      showed that these 5 key targets mainly involved in inflammation, oxidative 
      stress, and apoptosis. KEGG enrichment analysis showed that the pathways were 
      mainly enriched in the AGE-RAGE and HIF-1 signaling pathways. Molecular docking 
      revealed that the 5 key targets could combine well with their corresponding 
      active compounds. CONCLUSIONS: This study expounds the therapeutic effect of 
      Rhubarb-Coptis on DN from a holistic perspective, and provides a valuable basis 
      for clinical application and academic research.

LID - 10.1007/s12551-022-01016-7 [doi]
AB  - Intrinsically disordered regions in proteins have been shown to be important in 
      protein function. However, not all proteins contain the same amount of intrinsic 
      disorder. The variation in the levels of intrinsic disorder in different types of 
      proteins has been extensively studied over the last two decades. It is now known 
      that the levels of intrinsic disorder vary in proteins across organisms, 
      functions, diseases, and cellular locations. This review consolidates the known 
      trends in the abundance of intrinsic disorder identified in groups of proteins 
      across varying conditions and functions. It also presents new data towards the 
      understanding of intrinsic disorder in cell type-specific proteins. SUPPLEMENTARY

AB  - Dendritic cell (DC) migration is a fundamental step during execution of its 
      adaptive immunity functions. Studying DC migration characteristics is critical 
      for development of DC-dependent allergy treatments, vaccines, and cancer 
      immunotherapies. Here, a microfluidics-based single-cell migration platform is 
      described that enables high-throughput and precise bidirectional cell migration 
      assays. It also allows selective retrieval of cell subpopulations that have 
      different migratory potentials. Using this microfluidic platform, DC migration is 
      investigated in response to different chemoattractants and inhibitors, 
      quantitatively describe DC migration patterns and retrieve DC subpopulations of 
      different migratory potentials for differential gene expression analysis. This 
      platform opens an avenue for precise characterization of cell migration and 
      potential discovery of therapeutic modulators.

TI  - Selection signatures for local and regional adaptation in Chinese Mongolian horse 
      breeds reveal candidate genes for hoof health.
PG  - 35
LID - 10.1186/s12864-023-09116-8 [doi]
LID - 35
AB  - BACKGROUND: Thousands of years of natural and artificial selection since the 
      domestication of the horse has shaped the distinctive genomes of Chinese 
      Mongolian horse populations. Consequently, genomic signatures of selection can 
      provide insights into the human-mediated selection history of specific traits and 
      evolutionary adaptation to diverse environments. Here, we used genome-wide SNPs 
      from five distinct Chinese Mongolian horse populations to identify genomic 
      regions under selection for the population-specific traits, gait, black coat 
      colour, and hoof quality. Other global breeds were used to identify 
      regional-specific signatures of selection. RESULTS: We first identified the most 
      significant selection peak for the Wushen horse in the region on ECA23 harbouring 
      DMRT3, the major gene for gait. We detected selection signatures encompassing 
      several genes in the Baicha Iron Hoof horse that represent good biological 
      candidates for hoof health, including the CSPG4, PEAK1, EXPH5, WWP2 and HAS3 
      genes. In addition, an analysis of regional subgroups (Asian compared to 
      European) identified a single locus on ECA3 containing the ZFPM1 gene that is a 
      marker of selection for the major domestication event leading to the DOM2 horse 
      clade. CONCLUSIONS: Genomic variation at these loci in the Baicha Iron Hoof may 
      be leveraged in other horse populations to identify animals with superior hoof 
      health or those at risk of hoof-related pathologies. The overlap between the 
      selection signature in Asian horses with the DOM2 selection peak raises questions 
      about the nature of horse domestication events, which may have involved a 
      prehistoric clade other than DOM2 that has not yet been identified.

TI  - Protein coding variation in the J:ARC and J:DO outbred laboratory mouse stocks 
      provides a molecular basis for distinct research applications.
LID - 10.1093/g3journal/jkad015 [doi]
LID - jkad015
AB  - Outbred laboratory mice (Mus musculus) are readily available and have high 
      fecundity, making them a popular choice in biomedical research, especially 
      toxicological and pharmacological applications. Direct high throughput genome 
      sequencing (HTS) of these widely used research animals is an important genetic 
      quality control measure that enhances research reproducibility. HTS data have 
      been used to confirm the common origin of outbred stocks and to molecularly 
      define distinct outbred populations. But these data have also revealed unexpected 
      population structure and homozygosity in some populations; genetic features that 
      emerge when outbred stocks are not properly maintained. We used exome sequencing 
      to discover and interrogate protein-coding variation in a newly established 
      population of Swiss-derived outbred stock (J:ARC) that is closely related to 
      other, commonly used CD-1 outbred populations. We used these data to describe the 
      genetic architecture of the J:ARC population including heterozygosity, minor 
      allele frequency, LD decay, and we defined novel, protein-coding sequence 
      variation. These data reveal the expected genetic architecture for a properly 
      maintained outbred stock and provide a basis for the on-going genetic quality 
      control. We also compared these data to protein-coding variation found in a 
      multiparent outbred stock, the Diversity Outbred (J:DO). We found that the more 
      recently derived, multiparent outbred stock has significantly higher 
      interindividual variability, greater overall genetic variation, higher 
      heterozygosity, and fewer novel variants than the Swiss-derived J:ARC stock. 
      However, among the novel variants found in the J:DO stock, significantly more are 
      predicted to be protein-damaging. The fact that individuals from this population 
      can tolerate a higher load of potentially damaging variants highlights the 
      buffering effects of allelic diversity and the differing selective pressures in 
      these stocks. While both outbred stocks offer significant individual 
      heterozygosity, our data provide a molecular basis for their intended 
      applications, where the J:DO are best suited for studies requiring maximum, 
      population-level genetic diversity and power for mapping, while the J:ARC are 
      best suited as a general-purpose outbred stock with robust fecundity, relatively 
      low allelic diversity, and less potential for extreme phenotypic variability.

AB  - Down syndrome (DS) is the most common genetic cause of intellectual disability 
      and increases the risk of other brain-related dysfunctions, like seizures, 
      early-onset Alzheimer's disease, and autism. To reveal the molecular profiles of 
      DS-associated brain phenotypes, we performed a meta-data analysis of the 
      developmental DS brain transcriptome at cell type and co-expression module 
      levels. In the DS brain, astrocyte-, microglia-, and endothelial cell-associated 
      genes show upregulated patterns, whereas neuron- and oligodendrocyte-associated 
      genes show downregulated patterns. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis 
      identified cell type-enriched co-expressed gene modules. We present eight 
      representative cell-type modules for neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and 
      microglia. We classified the neuron modules into glutamatergic and GABAergic 
      neurons and associated them with detailed subtypes. Cell type modules were 
      interpreted by analyzing spatiotemporal expression patterns, functional 
      annotations, and co-expression networks of the modules. This study provides 
      insight into the mechanisms underlying brain abnormalities in DS and related 
      disorders.

AB  - Previous work in our laboratory has shown that mutations in prickle (pk) cause 
      myoclonic-like seizures and ataxia in Drosophila, similar to what is observed in 
      humans carrying mutations in orthologous PRICKLE genes. Here, we show that pk 
      mutant brains show elevated, sustained neuronal cell death that correlates with 
      increasing seizure penetrance, as well as an upregulation of mitochondrial 
      oxidative stress and innate immune response (IIR) genes. Moreover, flies 
      exhibiting more robust seizures show increased levels of IIR-associated target 
      gene expression suggesting they may be linked. Genetic knockdown in glia of 
      either arm of the IIR (Immune Deficiency [Imd] or Toll) leads to a reduction in 
      neuronal death, which in turn suppresses seizure activity, with oxidative stress 
      acting upstream of IIR. These data provide direct genetic evidence that oxidative 
      stress in combination with glial-mediated IIR leads to progression of an epilepsy 
      disorder.

      longevity.

AB  - As the elderly population increases, chronic, age-associated diseases are 
      challenging healthcare systems around the world. Nutrient limitation is well 
      known to slow the aging process and improve health. Regrettably, practicing 
      nutrient restriction to improve health is unachievable for most people. 
      Alternatively, pharmacological strategies are being pursued including myriocin 
      which increases lifespan in budding yeast. Myriocin impairs sphingolipid 
      synthesis, resulting in lowered amino acid pools which promote entry into a 
      quiescent, long-lived state. Here we present transcriptomic data during the first 
      6 hours of drug treatment that improves our mechanistic understanding of the 
      cellular response to myriocin and reveals a new role for ubiquitin in longevity. 
      Previously we found that the methionine transporter Mup1 traffics to the plasma 
      membrane normally in myriocin-treated cells but is not active and undergoes 
      endocytic clearance. We now show that UBI4, a gene encoding stressed-induced 
      ubiquitin, is vital for myriocin-enhanced lifespan. Furthermore, we show that 
      Mup1 fused to a deubiquitinase domain impairs myriocin-enhanced longevity. 
      Broader effects of myriocin treatment on ubiquitination are indicated by our 
      finding of a significant increase in K63-linked ubiquitin polymers following 
      myriocin treatment. Although proteostasis is broadly accepted as a pillar of 
      aging, our finding that ubiquitination of an amino acid transporter promotes 
      longevity in myriocin-treated cells is novel. Addressing the role of 
      ubiquitination/deubiquitination in longevity has the potential to reveal new 
      strategies and targets for promoting healthy aging.

AB  - Some interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) encode proteins that inhibit LINE-1 (L1) 
      retrotransposition. Here, we use immunoprecipitation followed by liquid 
      chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to identify proteins that associate with 
      the L1 ORF1-encoded protein (ORF1p) in ribonucleoprotein particles. Three ISG 
      proteins that interact with ORF1p inhibit retrotransposition: HECT and RLD domain 
      containing E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase 5 (HERC5); 2'-5'-oligoadenylate 
      synthetase-like (OASL); and helicase with zinc finger 2 (HELZ2). HERC5 
      destabilizes ORF1p, but does not affect its cellular localization. OASL impairs 
      ORF1p cytoplasmic foci formation. HELZ2 recognizes sequences and/or structures 
      within the L1 5'UTR to reduce L1 RNA, ORF1p, and ORF1p cytoplasmic foci levels. 
      Overexpression of WT or reverse transcriptase-deficient L1s lead to a modest 
      induction of IFN-α expression, which is abrogated upon HELZ2 overexpression. 
      Notably, IFN-α expression is enhanced upon overexpression of an ORF1p RNA binding 
      mutant, suggesting ORF1p binding might protect L1 RNA from "triggering" IFN-α 
      induction. Thus, ISG proteins can inhibit retrotransposition by different 
      mechanisms.

TI  - A liquid biopsy signature for predicting early recurrence in patients with 
      gastric cancer.
PG  - 1105-1116
LID - 10.1038/s41416-022-02138-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Gastric cancer (GC) patients who experience recurrence within the 
      first year following surgery (early recurrence [ER]) exhibit worse prognosis. 
      Herein, we established a microRNA-based liquid biopsy assay to predict ER in GC 
      patients. METHODS: A comprehensive biomarker discovery was performed by analysing 
      miRNA expression profiling in 271 primary GC tumours. Thereafter, the expression 
      of these biomarkers was validated in 290 GC cases, which included 218 tissues and 
      72 pre-treatment sera, from two independent institutions. RESULTS: A panel of 8 
      miRNAs was identified during the initial biomarker discovery, and this panel 
      could robustly predict ER in a tissue-based clinical cohort (area under the curve 
      [AUC]: 0.81). Furthermore, a model combining the miRNA panel, microsatellite 
      instability (MSI) status and tumour size exhibited superior predictive 
      performance (AUC: 0.86), and was defined as a Prediction of Early Recurrence in 
      GC (PERGC) signature, which was successfully validated in another independent 
      cohort (AUC: 0.82). Finally, the PERGC signature was translated into a liquid 
      biopsy assay (AUC: 0.81), and a multivariate regression analysis revealed this 
      signature to be an independent predictor for ER (odds ratio: 11.20). CONCLUSION: 
      We successfully established a miRNA-based liquid biopsy signature that robustly 
      predicts the risk of ER in GC patients.

TI  - The formation of HuR/YB1 complex is required for the stabilization of target mRNA 
      to promote myogenesis.
PG  - 1375-1392
LID - 10.1093/nar/gkac1245 [doi]
AB  - mRNA stability is the mechanism by which cells protect transcripts allowing their 
      expression to execute various functions that affect cell metabolism and fate. It 
      is well-established that RNA binding proteins (RBPs) such as HuR use their 
      ability to stabilize mRNA targets to modulate vital processes such as muscle 
      fiber formation (myogenesis). However, the machinery and the mechanisms 
      regulating mRNA stabilization are still elusive. Here, we identified Y-Box 
      binding protein 1 (YB1) as an indispensable HuR binding partner for mRNA 
      stabilization and promotion of myogenesis. Both HuR and YB1 bind to 409 common 
      mRNA targets, 147 of which contain a U-rich consensus motif in their 3' 
      untranslated region (3'UTR) that can also be found in mRNA targets in other cell 
      systems. YB1 and HuR form a heterodimer that associates with the U-rich consensus 
      motif to stabilize key promyogenic mRNAs. The formation of this complex involves 
      a small domain in HuR (227-234) that if mutated prevents HuR from reestablishing 
      myogenesis in siHuR-treated muscle cells. Together our data uncover that YB1 is a 
      key player in HuR-mediated stabilization of pro-myogenic mRNAs and provide the 
      first indication that the mRNA stability mechanism is as complex as other key 
      cellular processes such as mRNA decay and translation.

AB  - Coronaviruses (CoVs) of genera α, β, γ, and δ encode proteins that have a 
      PDZ-binding motif (PBM) consisting of the last four residues of the envelope (E) 
      protein (PBM core). PBMs may bind over 400 cellular proteins containing PDZ 
      domains (an acronym formed by the combination of the first letter of the names of 
      the three first proteins where this domain was identified), making them relevant 
      for the control of cell function. Three highly pathogenic human CoVs have been 
      identified to date: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and 
      Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2. The PBMs 
      of the three CoVs were virulence factors. SARS-CoV mutants in which the E protein 
      PBM core was replaced by the E protein PBM core from virulent or attenuated CoVs 
      were constructed. These mutants showed a gradient of virulence, depending on 
      whether the alternative PBM core introduced was derived from a virulent or an 
      attenuated CoV. Gene expression patterns in the lungs of mice infected with 
      SARS-CoVs encoding each of the different PBMs were analyzed by RNA sequencing of 
      infected lung tissues. E protein PBM of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 dysregulated gene 
      expression related to ion transport and cell homeostasis. Decreased expression of 
      cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) mRNA, essential for 
      alveolar edema resolution, was shown. Reduced CFTR mRNA levels were associated 
      with edema accumulation in the alveoli of mice infected with SARS-CoV and 
      SARS-CoV-2. Compounds that increased CFTR expression and activity, significantly 
      reduced SARS-CoV-2 growth in cultured cells and protected against mouse 
      infection, suggesting that E protein virulence is mediated by a decreased CFTR 
      expression. IMPORTANCE Three highly pathogenic human CoVs have been identified: 
      SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2. The E protein PBMs of these three CoVs were 
      virulence factors. Gene expression patterns associated with the different PBM 
      motifs in the lungs of infected mice were analyzed by deep sequencing. E protein 
      PBM motif of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 dysregulated the expression of genes related 
      to ion transport and cell homeostasis. A decrease in the mRNA expression of the 
      cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), which is essential 
      for edema resolution, was observed. The reduction of CFTR mRNA levels was 
      associated with edema accumulation in the lungs of mice infected with SARS-CoV-2. 
      Compounds that increased the expression and activity of CFTR drastically reduced 
      the production of SARS-CoV-2 and protected against its infection in a mice model. 
      These results allowed the identification of cellular targets for the selection of 
      antivirals.

AB  - DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation have been implicated in the regulatory 
      dynamics of gene expression in normal development and differentiation. 
      5-Hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), created by the ten-eleven translocation (TET) 
      protein-catalyzed oxidation of 5-methylcytosine (5mC), is abundant in the brain, 
      but the genome-wide distribution and impact of 5hmC during diverse neuronal 
      differentiation remain unknown. Here, we used an in vitro model to differentiate 
      mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) into ventral midbrain and hindbrain neural 
      progenitors, followed by characterizing global 5hmC distribution using a 
      nano-5hmC-seal approach. The 5hmC pattern was dynamic in promoter, exon, and 
      enhancer regions, associated with gene activation and repression. For example, 
      ventral midbrain markers (Lmx1a, Otx2, and Th) and hindbrain markers (Hoxa1, 
      Zic1, and Tph1) acquire 5hmC and are upregulated during differentiation. Among 
      the differentially expressed genes involved in both midbrain and hindbrain 
      lineage commitment, phosphatase and tensin homolog (Pten) was identified as a key 
      regulator for neuronal development. We confirmed that Pten knockout disrupted the 
      normal differentiation of midbrain/hindbrain neural progenitors, resulting in 
      immature neurons. In addition, 5421 and 4624 differentially hydroxymethylated 
      regions (DhMRs) were identified in the differentiation of Pten(-/-) mESC into 
      ventral midbrain and hindbrain progenitors, respectively. Gene ontology analysis 
      showed that the majority of these DhMRs were associated with neurogenesis, 
      ectoderm development, and signal transduction. Moreover, further combinational 
      analysis of the 5hmC pattern and transcriptomic profile in the midbrain 
      progenitor cells demonstrated Pten as a toggle to modulate mitochondrial 
      associated pathways. Therefore, our findings elucidated the molecular mechanisms 
      underlying lineage-specific differentiation of pluripotent stem cells to the 
      midbrain/hindbrain progenitors, where Pten participates as one key regulator.

TI  - Culture Protocol and Transcriptomic Analysis of Murine SVZ NPCs and OPCs.
PG  - 983-1000
LID - 10.1007/s12015-022-10492-z [doi]
AB  - The mammalian adult brain contains two neural stem and precursor (NPC) niches: 
      the subventricular zone [SVZ] lining the lateral ventricles and the subgranular 
      zone [SGZ] in the hippocampus. From these, SVZ NPCs represent the largest NPC 
      pool. While SGZ NPCs typically only produce neurons and astrocytes, SVZ NPCs 
      produce neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes throughout life. Of particular 
      importance is the generation and replacement of oligodendrocytes, the only 
      myelinating cells of the central nervous system (CNS). SVZ NPCs contribute to 
      myelination by regenerating the parenchymal oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) 
      pool and by differentiating into oligodendrocytes in the developing and 
      demyelinated brain. The neurosphere assay has been widely adopted by the 
      scientific community to facilitate the study of NPCs in vitro. Here, we present a 
      streamlined protocol for culturing postnatal and adult SVZ NPCs and OPCs from 
      primary neurosphere cells. We characterize the purity and differentiation 
      potential as well as provide RNA-sequencing profiles of postnatal SVZ NPCs, 
      postnatal SVZ OPCs and adult SVZ NPCs. We show that primary neurospheres cells 
      generated from postnatal and adult SVZ differentiate into neurons, astrocytes and 
      oligodendrocytes concurrently and at comparable levels. SVZ OPCs are generated by 
      subjecting primary neurosphere cells to OPC growth factors fibroblast growth 
      factor (FGF) and platelet-derived growth factor-AA (PDGF-AA). We further show SVZ 
      OPCs can differentiate into oligodendrocytes in the absence and presence of 
      thyroid hormone T3. Transcriptomic analysis confirmed the identities of each cell 
      population and revealed novel immune and signalling pathways expressed in an age 
      and cell type specific manner.

TI  - Next-Generation Sequencing in the Assessment of the Transcriptomic Landscape of 
      DNA Damage Repair Genes in Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm, Chronic Venous Disease and 
      Lower Extremity Artery Disease.
LID - 10.3390/ijms24010551 [doi]
LID - 551
AB  - Vascular diseases are one of the most common causes of death and morbidity. Lower 
      extremity artery disease (LEAD), abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) and chronic 
      venous disease (CVD) belong to this group of conditions and exhibit various 
      presentations and courses; thus, there is an urgent need for revealing new 
      biomarkers for monitoring and potential treatment. Next-generation sequencing of 
      mRNA allows rapid and detailed transcriptome analysis, allowing us to pinpoint 
      the most pronounced differences between the mRNA expression profiles of vascular 
      disease patients. Comparison of expression data of 519 DNA-repair-related genes 
      obtained from mRNA next-generation sequencing revealed significant transcriptomic 
      marks characterizing AAA, CVD and LEAD. Statistical, gene set enrichment analysis 
      (GSEA), gene ontology (GO) and literature analyses were applied and highlighted 
      many DNA repair and accompanying processes, such as cohesin functions, oxidative 
      stress, homologous recombination, ubiquitin turnover, chromatin remodelling and 
      DNA double-strand break repair. Surprisingly, obtained data suggest the 
      contribution of genes engaged in the regulatory function of DNA repair as a key 
      component that could be used to distinguish between analyzed conditions. DNA 
      repair-related genes depicted in the presented study as dysregulated in AAA, CVD 
      and LEAD could be utilized in the design of new biomarkers or therapies 
      associated with these diseases.

TI  - Single-Cell RNA-Sequencing Reveals Interactions between Endometrial Stromal 
      Cells, Epithelial Cells, and Lymphocytes during Mouse Embryo Implantation.
LID - 10.3390/ijms24010213 [doi]
LID - 213
AB  - The decidualization of endometrial stromal cells (ESCs) is an essential process 
      facilitating embryo implantation. However, the roles of non-decidualized and 
      decidualized ESCs in regulating the microenvironment of a receptive endometrium 
      remain unclear. We investigated single-cell transcriptomic changes in the uterus 
      of a CD-1 mouse model at the post-implantation stage. The implantation and 
      inter-implantation sites of the uteruses of pregnant mice at 4.5 and 5.5 days 
      post-coitum were dissected for single-cell RNA sequencing. We identified eight 
      cell types: epithelial cells, stromal cells, endothelial cells, mesothelial 
      cells, lymphocytes, myocytes, myeloids, and pericytes. The ESC transcriptome 
      suggests that the four ESC subtypes are involved in the extracellular remodeling 
      during implantation. The trajectory plot of ESC subtypes indicates embryo 
      implantation that involves a differentiation pathway from undifferentiated ESCs 
      (ESC 1) to decidualized ESCs (DEC ESCs), with distinct signaling pathways between 
      the ESC subtypes. Furthermore, the ligand-receptor analysis suggests that ESCs 
      communicate with epithelial cells and immune cells through nectin and ICAM 
      signaling. Collectively, both decidualized and non-decidualized ESCs may regulate 
      the endometrial microenvironment for optimal endometrial receptivity and immune 
      tolerance. This study provides insights on the molecular and cellular 
      characteristics of mouse ESCs in modulating the epithelial and lymphocyte 
      functions during early embryo implantation.

TI  - Probiotic Properties and Proteomic Analysis of Pediococcus pentosaceus 1101.
LID - 10.3390/foods12010046 [doi]
LID - 46
AB  - Pediococcus pentosaceus 1101 was identified by using 16S rRNA and MALDI-Biotyper. 
      The strain was exposed to conditions that resemble the gastrointestinal tract 
      (GT) to evaluate its probiotic properties. That included the growth kinetics, 
      proteolytic and inhibitory activities within a pH range, survival at low pH and 
      in the presence of bile salts, antagonistic activity, cell-adhesion properties, 
      and antibiotic resistance. The evaluation was followed by a genomic and proteomic 
      analysis that involved the identification of proteins obtained under control and 
      gastrointestinal conditions. The strain showed antagonistic activity against 
      Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, high resistance to acidity (87% 
      logarithmic survival rate, pH 2) and bile salts (99% logarithmic survival rate, 
      0.5% w/v), and hydrophobic binding, as well as sensitivity to penicillin, 
      amoxicillin, and chloramphenicol. On the other hand, P. pentosaceus 1101 has a 
      genome size of 1.76 Mbp, with 1754 coding sequences, 55 rRNAs, and 33 tRNAs. The 
      proteomic analysis showed that 120 proteins were involved in mechanisms in which 
      the strain senses the effects of acid and bile salts. Moreover, the strain 
      produces at least one lytic enzyme (N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase; 32 kDa) 
      that may be related to the antimicrobial activity. Therefore, proteins identified 
      might be a key factor when it comes to the adaptation of P. pentosaceus 1101 into 
      the GT and associated with its technological and probiotic properties.

      profile by proteomics was performed. RESULTS: A gene ontology analysis revealed 
      that radiation-induced protein changes are associated with metabolic alterations, 
      which were further supported by a reduction of both cellular ATP levels and 
      glucose uptake. Most of the radiation-induced deregulated targets exhibited a 
      decreased expression, as was the case of cathepsin D, a lysosomal protease 
      associated with cell death, which was validated by Western blot. We also found 
      that irradiated macrophages exhibited an increased expression of the transferrin 
      receptor 1 (TfR1), which is responsible for the uptake of transferrin-bound iron. 
      TfR1 upregulation was also found in tumor-associated mouse macrophages upon tumor 
      irradiation. In vitro irradiated macrophages also presented a trend for increased 
      divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1), which transports iron from the endosome to 
      the cytosol, and a significant increase in iron release. CONCLUSIONS: Irradiated 
      macrophages present lower ATP levels and glucose uptake, and exhibit decreased 
      cathepsin D expression, while increasing TfR1 expression and altering iron 
      metabolism.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common abdominal cancer with 
      dissatisfactory therapeutic effects. The discovery of cuproptosis lights on new 
      approach for cancer treatment and assessment. So far, there is extremely limited 
      research investigating the roles of cuproptosis-related (CR) genes in cancers. 
      METHODS: A novel CR risk signature was constructed using the Lasso regression 
      analysis. Its prognostic value was assessed via a series of survival analyses and 
      validated in three GEO cohorts. The effects of CR risk signature on tumor immune 
      microenvironment (TIM) were explored through CIBERSORT, ESTIMATE, and ssGSEA 
      algorithms. Using GESA, we investigated its impacts on various metabolism 
      process. The somatic mutation features of CR signature genes were also explored 
      via cBioPortal database. Using tumor mutation burden, expressions of immune 
      checkpoints, TIDE score, IMvigor 210 cohort, and GSE109211 dataset, we explored 
      the potential associations of CR risk score with the efficacy of immune 
      checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and sorafenib. Finally, the biofunctions of DLAT in 
      HCC cells were ascertained through qPCR, immunohistochemistry, colony formation, 
      and Transwell assays. RESULTS: FDX1, DLAT, CDKN2A and GLS constituted the CR risk 
      signature. CR risk signature possessed high prognostic value and was also 
      applicable to three validation cohorts. Meanwhile, it could improve the accuracy 
      and clinical making-decision benefit of traditional prognostic model. Moreover, 
      high CR risk was indicative of unfavorable anti-tumor immune response and active 
      metabolisms of glycolysis and nucleotide. As for therapeutic correlation, CR risk 
      score was a potential biomarker for predicting the efficacy of ICIs and 
      sorafenib. Through qPCR and immunohistochemistry detection in clinical samples, 
      we reconfirmed DLAT was significantly upregulated in HCC samples. Overexpression 
      of DLAT could promote the proliferation, migration, and invasion of HepG2 and 
      HuH-7 cells. CONCLUSIONS: The novel CR risk signature greatly contributed to the 
      clinical assessment of HCC. Cuproptosis regulatory gene DLAT possessed 
      cancer-promoting capacities and was expected to be a promising therapeutic target 
      for HCC.

AB  - Spermatogenesis carries the task of precise intergenerational transmission of 
      genetic information from the paternal genome and involves complex developmental 
      processes regulated by the testicular microenvironment. Studies performed mainly 
      in mouse models have established the theoretical basis for spermatogenesis, yet 
      the wide interspecies differences preclude direct translation of the findings, 
      and farm animal studies are progressing slowly. More than 32,000 cells from 
      prepubertal (3-month-old) and pubertal (24-month-old) buffalo testes were 
      analyzed by using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), and dynamic gene 
      expression roadmaps of germ and somatic cell development were generated. In 
      addition to identifying the dynamic processes of sequential cell fate 
      transitions, the global cell-cell communication essential to maintain regular 
      spermatogenesis in the buffalo testicular microenvironment was uncovered. The 
      findings provide the theoretical basis for establishing buffalo germline stem 
      cells in vitro or culturing organoids and facilitating the expansion of superior 
      livestock breeding.

      of Expression, Prognostic Significance, and Immune Infiltration.
PG  - 6109052

AB  - Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), as an intractable malignancy, still 
      causes an extremely high mortality worldwide. The ubiquitin-specific protease 
      (USP) family constitutes the major part of deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) which 
      has been reported to be involved in initiation and progression of various 
      malignancies via the function of deubiquitination. However, the biological 
      function and clinical values of USPs in PDAC have not been comprehensively 
      elucidated. In this study, Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis 
      (GEPIA), Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets, UALCAN database, and the Human 
      Protein Atlas (HPA) online tool were used to analyze the expression level and the 
      relationship between USP expression and clinicopathological features in PDAC. 
      Survival module of HPA and Kaplan-Meier plotter (KMP) databases was recruited to 
      explore the prognostic value of USPs. Tumor Immune Estimation Resource (TIMER) 
      online tool and KMP databases were utilized to elucidate tumor immune 
      infiltration and immune-related survival of USPs. CBioPortal online tool was used 
      to identify the gene mutation level of USPs in PDAC. Both cBioPortal and 
      LinkedOmics were used to confirm the potential biological functions of USPs in 
      PDAC. Our study showed that USP10, USP14, USP18, USP32, USP33, and USP39 (termed 
      as six-USPs) expressions were significantly elevated in tumor tissues. The high 
      expression of the four USPs (USP10, USP14, USP18, and USP39) indicated a poor 
      prognosis. A significant relationship was indicated between the expression of 
      six-USPs and clinicopathological features. Also, the expression of six-USPs was 
      related to promoter methylation level. Moreover, more than 40% genetic 
      alterations and mutations were discovered in six-USPs. Furthermore, the six-USP 
      expression was correlated with immune infiltration and immune-related prognosis. 
      The functional analysis found that the six-USPs were involved in various 
      biological processes and signaling pathways, such as nucleocytoplasmic transport, 
      choline metabolism in cancer, cell cycle, ErbB signaling pathway, RIG-I-like 
      receptor signaling pathway, TGF-β signaling pathway, and TNF signaling pathway. 
      In conclusion, the results showed that six-USPs are potential prognostic 
      biomarkers and can be recruited as possible therapeutic targets of PDAC.

AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) leads to severe functional deficits. Currently, there 
      are no available pharmacological treatments to promote neurological recovery in 
      SCI patients. Recent work from our group has shown that a baclofen treatment can 
      promote functional recovery after a compression SCI in mice [1]. Here, we provide 
      transcriptomic (RNA-seq) data from adult mouse spinal cords collected 7 days 
      after a compression SCI and baclofen (vs vehicle) administration. The Illumina 
      NovaSeq 6000 platform was used to generate the raw transcriptomic data. In 
      addition, we also present bioinformatic analyses including differential gene 
      expression analysis, enrichment analyses for various functional annotations (gene 
      ontology, KEGG and BioCarta pathways or InterPro domains) and transcription 
      factor targets. The raw RNA-seq data has been uploaded to the NCBI Sequence Read 
      Archive (SRA) database (Bioproject ID PRJNA886048). The data generated from the 
      bioinformatic analyses is contained within the article.

AB  - Coronary heart disease is a cardiovascular disease with high morbidity and 
      mortality. Although great progress has been made in treatment, the prognosis is 
      still very poor. Therefore, this project aims to screen potential diagnostic 
      markers and therapeutic targets related to the progression of coronary heart 
      disease. A total of 94 overlapping differentially expressed mRNAs and 70 
      differentially expressed miRNAs were identified from GSE20681, GSE12288, 
      GSE49823, and GSE105449. Through a series of bioinformatics methods and 
      experiment, we obtained 5 core miRNA-mRNA regulatory pairs, and selected 
      miR-338-3p/RPS23 for functional analysis. Moreover, we found that RPS23 directly 
      targets miR-338-3p by dual luciferase assay, western, and qPCR. And the 
      expression of miR-338-3p and RPS23 is negatively correlated. The AUC value of 
      miR-338-3p is 0.847. Downregulation of miR-338-3p can significantly inhibit the 
      proliferation and migration of HUVEC. On the contrary, overexpression of 
      miR-338-3p promoted the proliferation and migration of HUVEC. In addition, the 
      interference of RPS23 expression can reverse the regulation of miR-338-3p on 
      HUVEC proliferation. In conclusion, miR-338-3p/RPS23 may be involved in the 
      progression of coronary heart disease, and miR-338-3p may be a diagnostic 
      biomarker and therapeutic target for coronary heart disease.

TI  - TCF-1 regulates NKG2D expression on CD8 T cells during anti-tumor responses.
PG  - 1581-1601
LID - 10.1007/s00262-022-03323-0 [doi]
AB  - Cancer immunotherapy relies on improving T cell effector functions against 
      malignancies, but despite the identification of several key transcription factors 
      (TFs), the biological functions of these TFs are not entirely understood. We 
      developed and utilized a novel, clinically relevant murine model to dissect the 
      functional properties of crucial T cell transcription factors during anti-tumor 
      responses. Our data showed that the loss of TCF-1 in CD8 T cells also leads to 
      loss of key stimulatory molecules such as CD28. Our data showed that TCF-1 
      suppresses surface NKG2D expression on naïve and activated CD8 T cells via key 
      transcriptional factors Eomes and T-bet. Using both in vitro and in vivo models, 
      we uncovered how TCF-1 regulates critical molecules responsible for peripheral 
      CD8 T cell effector functions. Finally, our unique genetic and molecular 
      approaches suggested that TCF-1 also differentially regulates essential kinases. 
      These kinases, including LCK, LAT, ITK, PLC-γ1, P65, ERKI/II, and JAK/STATs, are 
      required for peripheral CD8 T cell persistent function during alloimmunity. 
      Overall, our molecular and bioinformatics data demonstrate the mechanism by which 
      TCF-1 modulated several critical aspects of T cell function during CD8 T cell 
      response to cancer. Summary Figure: TCF-1 is required for persistent function of 
      CD8 T cells but dispensable for anti-tumor response. Here, we have utilized a 
      novel mouse model that lacks TCF-1 specifically on CD8 T cells for an allogeneic 
      transplant model. We uncovered a molecular mechanism of how TCF-1 regulates key 
      signaling pathways at both transcriptomic and protein levels. These key molecules 
      included LCK, LAT, ITK, PLC-γ1, p65, ERK I/II, and JAK/STAT signaling. Next, we 
      showed that the lack of TCF-1 impacted phenotype, proinflammatory cytokine 
      production, chemokine expression, and T cell activation. We provided clinical 
      evidence for how these changes impact GVHD target organs (skin, small intestine, 
      and liver). Finally, we provided evidence that TCF-1 regulates NKG2D expression 
      on mouse naïve and activated CD8 T cells. We have shown that CD8 T cells from 
      TCF-1 cKO mice mediate cytolytic functions via NKG2D.

AB  - Many critical life processes are regulated by input from 24-hour external 
      light/dark cycles, such as metabolism, cellular homeostasis, and detoxification. 
      The circadian clock, which helps coordinate the response to these diurnal 
      light/dark cycles, remains rhythmic across lifespan; however, rhythmic transcript 
      expression is altered during normal aging. To better understand how aging impacts 
      diurnal expression, we present an improved Fourier-based method for detecting and 
      visualizing rhythmicity that is based on the relative power of the 24-hour period 
      compared to other periods (RP24). We apply RP24 to transcript-level expression 
      profiles from the heads of young (5-day) and old (55-day) Drosophila 
      melanogaster, and reveal novel age-dependent rhythmicity changes that may be 
      masked at the gene level. We show that core clock transcripts phase advance 
      during aging, while most rhythmic transcripts phase delay. Transcripts rhythmic 
      only in young flies tend to peak before lights on, while transcripts only 
      rhythmic in old peak after lights on. We show that several pathways, including 
      glutathione metabolism, gain or lose coordinated rhythmic expression with age, 
      providing insight into possible mechanisms of age-onset neurodegeneration. 
      Remarkably, we find that many pathways show very robust coordinated rhythms 
      across lifespan, highlighting their putative roles in promoting neural health. We 
      investigate statistically enriched transcription factor binding site motifs that 
      may be involved in these rhythmicity changes.

AB  - The burgeoning field of genomics as applied to personalized medicine, 
      epidemiology, conservation, agriculture, forensics, drug development, and other 
      fields comes with large computational and bioinformatics costs, which are often 
      inaccessible to student trainees in classroom settings at universities. However, 
      with increased availability of resources such as NSF XSEDE, Google Cloud, Amazon 
      AWS, and other high-performance computing (HPC) clouds and clusters for 
      educational purposes, a growing community of academicians are working on teaching 
      the utility of HPC resources in genomics and big data analyses. Here, I describe 
      the successful implementation of a semester-long (16 week) upper division 
      undergraduate/graduate level course in Computational Genomics and Bioinformatics 
      taught at San Diego State University in Spring 2022. Students were trained in the 
      theory, algorithms and hands-on applications of genomic data quality control, 
      assembly, annotation, multiple sequence alignment, variant calling, phylogenomic 
      analyses, population genomics, genome-wide association studies, and differential 
      gene expression analyses using RNAseq data on their own dedicated 6-CPU NSF XSEDE 
      Jetstream virtual machines. All lesson plans, activities, examinations, 
      tutorials, code, lectures, and notes are publicly available at

TI  - Combined thioredoxin reductase and glutaminase inhibition exerts synergistic 
      anti-tumor activity in MYC-high high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma.

AB  - Approximately 50%-55% of high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) patients 
      have MYC oncogenic pathway activation. Because MYC is not directly targetable, we 
      have analyzed molecular pathways enriched in MYC-high HGSOC tumors to identify 
      potential therapeutic targets. Here, we report that MYC-high HGSOC tumors show 
      enrichment in genes controlled by NRF2, an antioxidant signaling pathway, along 
      with increased thioredoxin redox activity. Treatment of MYC-high HGSOC tumors 
      cells with US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved thioredoxin reductase 1 
      (TrxR1) inhibitor auranofin resulted in significant growth suppression and 
      apoptosis in MYC-high HGSOC cells in vitro and also significantly reduced tumor 
      growth in an MYC-high HGSOC patient-derived tumor xenograft. We found that 
      auranofin treatment inhibited glycolysis in MYC-high cells via oxidation-induced 
      GAPDH inhibition. Interestingly, in response to auranofin-induced glycolysis 
      inhibition, MYC-high HGSOC cells switched to glutamine metabolism for survival. 
      Depletion of glutamine with either glutamine starvation or glutaminase (GLS1) 
      inhibitor CB-839 exerted synergistic anti-tumor activity with auranofin in HGSOC 
      cells and OVCAR-8 cell line xenograft. These findings suggest that applying a 
      combined therapy of GLS1 inhibitor and TrxR1 inhibitor could effectively treat 
      MYC-high HGSOC patients.

TI  - U5 snRNP Core Proteins Are Key Components of the Defense Response against Viral 
      Infection through Their Roles in Programmed Cell Death and Interferon Induction.
LID - 10.3390/v14122710 [doi]
LID - 2710
AB  - The spliceosome is a massive ribonucleoprotein structure composed of five small 
      nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) complexes that catalyze the removal of introns 
      from pre-mature RNA during constitutive and alternative splicing. EFTUD2, PRPF8, 
      and SNRNP200 are core components of the U5 snRNP, which is crucial for 
      spliceosome function as it coordinates and performs the last steps of the 
      splicing reaction. Several studies have demonstrated U5 snRNP proteins as 
      targeted during viral infection, with a limited understanding of their 
      involvement in virus-host interactions. In the present study, we deciphered the 
      respective impact of EFTUD2, PRPF8, and SNRNP200 on viral replication using 
      mammalian reovirus as a model. Using a combination of RNA silencing, real-time 
      cell analysis, cell death and viral replication assays, we discovered distinct 
      and partially overlapping novel roles for EFTUD2, PRPF8, and SNRNP200 in cell 
      survival, apoptosis, necroptosis, and the induction of the interferon response 
      pathway. For instance, we demonstrated that EFTUD2 and SNRNP200 are required for 
      both apoptosis and necroptosis, whereas EFTUD2 and PRPF8 are required for optimal 
      interferon response against viral infection. Moreover, we demonstrated that 
      EFTUD2 restricts viral replication, both in a single cycle and multiple cycles of 
      viral replication. Altogether, these results establish U5 snRNP core components 
      as key elements of the cellular antiviral response.

TI  - Network Pharmacology and Molecular Docking Study on the Multi-Target Mechanisms 
      of Aloe vera for Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis Treatment.
LID - 10.3390/plants11243585 [doi]
LID - 3585
AB  - Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a leading cause of chronic liver disease 
      with limited treatment options. The widely distributed plant Aloe vera has shown 
      protective effects against NASH in animals, yet the precise mechanism remains 
      unknown. In this study, we investigated the potential mechanisms underlying the 
      anti-NASH effects of Aloe vera using a network pharmacology and molecular docking 
      approach. By searching online databases and analyzing the Gene Expression Omnibus 
      dataset, we obtained 260 Aloe vera-NASH common targets. Gene Ontology and Kyoto 
      Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analyses showed that the common 
      targets were strongly associated with the key pathological processes implicated 
      in NASH, including lipid and glucose metabolism, inflammation, apoptosis, 
      oxidative stress, and liver fibrosis. Four core proteins, AKT serine/threonine 
      kinase 1 (AKT1), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), transcription factor c-Jun, 
      and tumor suppressor protein p53, were identified from compound-target-pathway 
      and protein-protein interaction networks. Molecular docking analysis verified 
      that the active ingredients of Aloe vera were able to interact with the core 
      proteins, especially AKT1 and TNFα. The results demonstrate the multi-compound, 
      multi-target, and multi-pathway mechanisms of Aloe vera against NASH. Our study 
      has shown the scientific basis for further experiments in terms of the mechanism 
      to develop Aloe vera-based natural products as complementary treatments for NASH. 
      Furthermore, it identifies novel drug candidates based on the structures of Aloe 
      vera's active compounds.

TI  - The Protective and Therapeutic Anti-Alzheimer Potential of Olea europaea L. cv. 
      Picual: An In Silico and In Vivo Study.
LID - 10.3390/metabo12121178 [doi]
LID - 1178
AB  - LC-HRESIMS metabolomic profiling of Olea europaea L. cv. Picual (OEP) (Saudi 
      Arabian olive cultivar, F. Oleacea) revealed 18 compounds. Using pharmacology 
      networking to specify the targets of the identified compounds with a relationship 
      to Alzheimer's disease, it was possible to identify the VEGFA, AChE, and DRD2 
      genes as the top correlated genes to Alzheimer's disease with 8, 8, and 6 
      interactions in the same order. The mechanism of action on cellular components, 
      biological processes, and molecular functions was determined by gene enrichment 
      analysis. A biological pathway comparison revealed 13 shared pathways between the 
      identified genes and Alzheimer protein genes (beta-amyloid band tau proteins). 
      The suggested extract's anti-Alzheimer potential in silico screening was 
      confirmed through in vivo investigation in regressing the neurodegenerative 
      features of Alzheimer's dementia in an aluminum-intoxicated rat model (protective 
      and therapeutic effects, 100 mg/kg b.w.). In vivo results suggested that OEP 
      extract significantly improved Alzheimer's rats, which was indicated by the crude 
      extract's ability to improve T-maze performance; lower elevated serum levels of 
      AChE, AB peptide, and Ph/T ratio; and normalize the reduced level of TAC during 
      the study. The results presented in this study may provide potential dietary 
      supplements for the management of Alzheimer's disease.

TI  - Genome-Scale Metabolic Modeling Reveals Sequential Dysregulation of Glutathione 
      Metabolism in Livers from Patients with Alcoholic Hepatitis.
LID - 10.3390/metabo12121157 [doi]
LID - 1157
AB  - Alcoholic hepatitis (AH) is the most severe form of alcoholic liver disease for 
      which there is no efficacious treatment aiding most patients. AH manifests 
      differently in individuals, with some patients showing debilitating symptoms more 
      so than others. Previous studies showed significant metabolic dysregulation 
      associated with AH. Therefore, we sought to analyze how the activity of metabolic 
      pathways differed in the liver of patients with varying degrees of AH severity. 
      We utilized a genome-scale metabolic modeling approach that allowed for 
      integration of a generic human cellular metabolic model with specific RNA-seq 
      data corresponding to healthy and multiple liver disease states to predict the 
      metabolic fluxes within each disease state. Additionally, we performed a 
      systems-level analysis of the transcriptomic data and predicted metabolic flux 
      data to identify the regulatory and functional differences in liver metabolism 
      with increasing severity of AH. Our results provide unique insights into the 
      sequential dysregulation of the solute transport mechanisms underlying the 
      glutathione metabolic pathway with increasing AH disease severity. We propose 
      targeting of the solute transporters in the glutathione pathway to mimic the flux 
      activity of the healthy liver state as a potential therapeutic intervention for 
      AH.

TI  - Comparative Analysis of Physiological, Hormonal and Transcriptomic Responses 
      Reveal Mechanisms of Saline-Alkali Tolerance in Autotetraploid Rice (Oryza sativa 
      L.).
LID - 10.3390/ijms232416146 [doi]
LID - 16146
AB  - Saline-alkali soil has posed challenges to the growth of agricultural crops, 
      while polyploidy often show greater adaptability in diverse and extreme 
      environments including saline-alkali stress, but its defense mechanisms in rice 
      remain elusive. Herein, we explored the mechanisms of enhanced saline-alkali 
      tolerance of autotetraploid rice 93-11T relative to diploid rice 93-11D, based on 
      physiological, hormonal and transcriptomic profilings. Physiologically, the 
      enhanced saline-alkali tolerance in 93-11T was manifested in higher soluble sugar 
      accumulation and stronger superoxide dismutase (SOD) and peroxidase (POD) 
      activities in leaves during 24 h after saline-alkali shock. Furthermore, various 
      hormone levels in leaves of 93-11T altered greatly, such as the negative 
      correlation between salicylic acid (SA) and the other four hormones changed to 
      positive correlation due to polyploidy. Global transcriptome profiling revealed 
      that the upregulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in leaves and roots of 
      93-11T were more abundant than that in 93-11D, and there were more DEGs in roots 
      than in leaves under saline-alkali stress. Genes related to phytohormone signal 
      transduction of auxin (AUX) and SA in roots, lignin biosynthesis in leaves or 
      roots, and wax biosynthesis in leaves were obviously upregulated in 93-11T 
      compared with 93-11D under saline-alkali condition. Collectively, 93-11T 
      subjected to saline-alkali stress possibly possesses higher osmotic regulation 
      ability due to cuticular wax synthesis, stronger negative regulation of reactive 
      oxygen species (ROS) production by increasing the SA levels and maintaining 
      relative lower levels of IAA, and higher antioxidant capacity by increasing 
      activities of SOD and POD, as well as lignin biosynthesis. Our research provides 
      new insights for exploring the mechanisms of saline-alkali tolerance in polyploid 
      rice and discovering new gene targets for rice genetic improvement.

TI  - Phellinus baumii Polyphenol: A Potential Therapeutic Candidate against Lung 
      Cancer Cells.
LID - 10.3390/ijms232416141 [doi]
LID - 16141
AB  - Phellinus baumii, a fungus that grows on mulberry trees and is used in 
      traditional Chinese medicine, exerts therapeutic effects against various 
      diseases, including cancer. Polyphenols, generally considered to be antioxidants, 
      have antitumor and proapoptotic effects. In this study, we identified the 
      composition of Phellinus baumii polyphenol (PBP) and characterized its 17 
      chemical components by UPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS. Furthermore, to clarify the potential 
      mechanism of PBP against Lung Cancer Cells, network pharmacology and experimental 
      verification were combined. Molecular docking elucidated the binding conformation 
      and mechanism of the primary active components (Osmundacetone and hispidin) to 
      the core targets CASP3, PARP1 and TP53. In addition, potential molecular 
      mechanisms of PBP predicted by network pharmacology analysis were validated in 
      vitro. PBP significantly inhibited the human lung cancer A549 cells and showed 
      typical apoptotic characteristics, without significant cytotoxicity to normal 
      human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells. Analysis using flow cytometry and western 
      blot indicated that PBP caused apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, reactive oxygen 
      species (ROS) accumulation, and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) depression 
      in A549 cells to exercise its antitumor effects. These results reveal that PBP 
      has great potential for use as an active ingredient for antitumor therapy.

TI  - Screening Key Genes and Biological Pathways in Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma by 
      Integrated Bioinformatics Analysis.
LID - 10.3390/ijms232415701 [doi]
LID - 15701
AB  - The purpose of this study was to identify the hub genes and biological pathways 
      of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) through bioinformatics analysis and potential 
      new therapeutic targets. In this study, three datasets were downloaded from the 
      Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between 
      NPC and normal tissues were analyzed using the GEO2R online tool. Volcano and 
      heat maps of the DEGs were visualized using the hiplot database. Gene ontology 
      (GO) and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment 
      analyses of the upregulated and downregulated DEGs were performed using the DAVID 
      database. Finally, we established a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network 
      using the STRING database and showed the differential expression of hub genes 
      between the normal and tumor tissues. In all, 109,371,221 upregulated DEGs and 
      139,226,520 downregulated DEGs were obtained in datasets GSE40290, GSE61218, and 
      GSE53819, respectively, and 18 common differential genes, named co-DEGs, were 
      screened in the three datasets. The most abundant biological GO terms of the 
      co-DEGs were inflammatory response et al. The KEGG pathway enrichment analysis 
      showed that co-DEGs mainly participated in the interleukin (IL)-17 signaling 
      pathway et al. Finally, we identified four hub genes using PPI analysis and 
      observed that three of them were highly expressed in tumor tissues. In this 
      study, the hub genes of NPC, such as PTGS2, and pathways such as IL-17 signaling, 
      were identified through bioinformatics analysis, which may be potential new 
      therapeutic targets for NPC.

TI  - Unraveling Signatures of Local Adaptation among Indigenous Groups from Mexico.
LID - 10.3390/genes13122251 [doi]
LID - 2251
AB  - Few studies have addressed how selective pressures have shaped the genetic 
      structure of the current Native American populations, and they have mostly 
      limited their inferences to admixed Latin American populations. Here, we searched 
      for local adaptation signals, based on integrated haplotype scores and population 
      branch statistics, in 325 Mexican Indigenous individuals with at least 99% Native 
      American ancestry from five previously defined geographical regions. Although 
      each region exhibited its own local adaptation profile, only PPARG and AJAP1, 
      both negative regulators of the Wnt/β catenin signaling pathway, showed 
      significant adaptation signals in all the tested regions. Several signals were 
      found, mainly in the genes related to the metabolic processes and immune 
      response. A pathway enrichment analysis revealed the overrepresentation of 
      selected genes related to several biological phenotypes/conditions, such as the 
      immune response and metabolic pathways, in agreement with previous studies, 
      suggesting that immunological and metabolic pressures are major drivers of human 
      adaptation. Genes related to the gut microbiome measurements were overrepresented 
      in all the regions, highlighting the importance of studying how humans have 
      coevolved with the microbial communities that colonize them. Our results provide 
      a further explanation of the human evolutionary history in response to 
      environmental pressures in this region.

TI  - Comprehensive Analysis of Potential Prognostic Values of ANGPTLs in Colorectal 
      Cancer.
LID - 10.3390/genes13122215 [doi]
LID - 2215
AB  - Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common malignant tumors in the world. 
      CRC recurrence and metastasis cause poor prognosis. ANGPTLs (angiopoietin-like 
      proteins) are a family of proteins that are widely involved in metabolic disease 
      and tumorigenesis. The roles of ANGPTLs in CRC are still controversial and 
      deserve further research. In this study, several databases were employed to 
      explore the expression profiles, prognostic values, genetic alterations, 
      potential biological function, and immune infiltration correlation of ANGPTLs in 
      CRC. The expression of ANGPTL4 was significantly positively correlated with the 
      stage of CRC. Therefore, cell and molecular experiments were further performed to 
      explore the roles of ANGPTL4. Our results showed that the transcriptions of 
      ANGPTLs in colon cancer and rectal cancer tissues were lower than those in normal 
      tissues, but the protein expression varied among different ANGPTLs. In addition, 
      the high expression of ANGPTLs led to a relatively poor oncological outcome. 
      Specifically, the expression of ANGPTL4 is significantly positively correlated 
      with the stage of CRC. Further investigation revealed that ANGPTLs are mainly 
      involved in signal transduction and the regulation of transcription, while KEGG 
      pathway analyses demonstrated pathways in cancer. Additionally, we also observed 
      that ANGPTL4 could promote the proliferation and migration of CRC cells, and four 
      specific small molecule compounds had potential ANGPTL4-binding capabilities, 
      suggesting the clinical application of these small molecule compounds on CRC 
      treatment. Our findings imply the prognostic values and potential therapeutic 
      targets of ANGPTLs in CRC.

TI  - Proteomics and Phospho-Proteomics Profiling of the Co-Formulation of Type I and 
      II Interferons, HeberFERON, in the Glioblastoma-Derived Cell Line U-87 MG.
LID - 10.3390/cells11244068 [doi]
LID - 4068
AB  - HeberFERON, a co-formulation of Interferon (IFN)-α2b and IFN-γ, has effects on 
      skin cancer and other solid tumors. It has antiproliferative effects over 
      glioblastoma multiform (GBM) clones and cultured cell lines, including U-87 MG. 
      Here, we report the first label-free quantitative proteomic and phospho-proteomic 
      analyses to evaluate changes induced by HeberFERON after 72 h incubation of U-87 
      MG that can explain the effect on cellular proliferation. LC-MS/MS, functional 
      enrichment and networking analysis were performed. We identified 7627 proteins; 
      122 and 211 were down- and up-regulated by HeberFERON (fold change > 2; p < 
      0.05), respectively. We identified 23,549 peptides (5692 proteins) and 8900 
      phospho-peptides; 523 of these phospho-peptides (359 proteins) were 
      differentially modified. Proteomic enrichment showed IFN signaling and its 
      control, direct and indirect antiviral mechanisms were the main modulated 
      processes. Phospho-proteome enrichment displayed the cell cycle as one of the 
      most commonly targeted events together with cytoskeleton organization; 
      translation/RNA splicing, autophagy and DNA repair, as represented biological 
      processes. There is a high interconnection of phosphoproteins in a molecular 
      network; mTOR occupies a centric hub with interactions with translation 
      machinery, cytoskeleton and autophagy components. Novel phosphosites and others 
      with unknown biological functionality in key players in the aforementioned 
      processes were regulated by HeberFERON and involved CDK and ERK kinases. These 
      findings open new experimental hypotheses regarding HeberFERON action. The 
      results obtained contribute to a better understanding of HeberFERON effector 
      mechanisms in the context of GBM treatment.

TI  - Identification of Key Genes and Biological Pathways Associated with Skeletal 
      Muscle Maturation and Hypertrophy in Bos taurus, Ovis aries, and Sus scrofa.
LID - 10.3390/ani12243471 [doi]
LID - 3471
AB  - The aim of the current study was to identify the major genes and pathways 
      involved in the process of hypertrophy and skeletal muscle maturation that is 
      common for Bos taurus, Ovis aries, and Sus scrofa species. Gene expression 
      profiles related to Bos taurus, Ovis aries, and Sus scrofa muscle, with accession 
      numbers GSE44030, GSE23563, and GSE38518, respectively, were downloaded from the 
      GEO database. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened out using the 
      Limma package of R software. Genes with Fold Change > 2 and an adjusted p-value < 
      0.05 were identified as significantly different between two treatments in each 
      species. Subsequently, gene ontology and pathway enrichment analyses were 
      performed. Moreover, hub genes were detected by creating a protein−protein 
      interaction network (PPI). The results of the analysis in Bos taurus showed that 
      in the period of 280 dpc−3-months old, a total of 1839 genes showed a significant 
      difference. In Ovis aries, however, during the period of 135dpc−2-months old, a 
      total of 486 genes were significantly different. Additionally, in the 91 
      dpc−adult period, a total of 2949 genes were significantly different in Sus 
      scrofa. The results of the KEGG pathway enrichment analysis and GO function 
      annotation in each species separately revealed that in Bos taurus, DEGs were 
      mainly enriched through skeletal muscle fiber development and skeletal muscle 
      contraction, and the positive regulation of fibroblast proliferation, positive 
      regulation of skeletal muscle fiber development, PPAR signaling pathway, and 
      HIF-1 signaling pathway. In Ovis aries, DEGs were mainly enriched through 
      regulating cell growth, skeletal muscle fiber development, the positive 
      regulation of fibroblast proliferation, skeletal muscle cell differentiation, and 
      the PI3K-Akt signaling, HIF-1 signaling, and Rap1 signaling pathways. In Sus 
      scrofa, DEGs were mainly enriched through regulating striated muscle tissue 
      development, the negative regulation of fibroblast proliferation and myoblast 
      differentiation, and the HIF-1 signaling, AMPK signaling, and PI3K-Akt signaling 
      pathways. Using a Venn diagram, 36 common DEGs were identified between Bos 
      taurus, Ovis aries, and Sus scrofa. A biological pathways analysis of 36 common 
      DEGs in Bos taurus, Ovis aries, and Sus scrofa allowed for the identification of 
      common pathways/biological processes, such as myoblast differentiation, the 
      regulation of muscle cell differentiation, and positive regulation of skeletal 
      muscle fiber development, that orchestrated the development and maturation of 
      skeletal muscle. As a result, hub genes were identified, including PPARGC1A, 
      MYOD1, EPAS1, IGF2, CXCR4, and APOA1, in all examined species. This study 
      provided a better understanding of the relationships between genes and their 
      biological pathways in the skeletal muscle maturation process.

TI  - A Systems Biology and LASSO-Based Approach to Decipher the 
      Transcriptome-Interactome Signature for Predicting Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.
LID - 10.3390/biology11121752 [doi]
LID - 1752
AB  - The lack of precise molecular signatures limits the early diagnosis of non-small 
      cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The present study used gene expression data and 
      interaction networks to develop a highly accurate model with the least absolute 
      shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) for predicting NSCLC. The differentially 
      expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in NSCLC compared with normal tissues 
      using TCGA and GTEx data. A biological network was constructed using DEGs, and 
      the top 20 upregulated and 20 downregulated hub genes were identified. These hub 
      genes were used to identify signature genes with penalized logistic regression 
      using the LASSO to predict NSCLC. Our model’s development involved the following 
      steps: (i) the dataset was divided into 80% for training (TR) and 20% for testing 
      (TD1); (ii) a LASSO logistic regression analysis was performed on the TR with 
      10-fold cross-validation and identified a combination of 17 genes as NSCLC 
      predictors, which were used further for development of the LASSO model. The 
      model’s performance was assessed on the TD1 dataset and achieved an accuracy and 
      an area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristics (AUC-ROC) of 
      0.986 and 0.998, respectively. Furthermore, the performance of the LASSO model 
      was evaluated using three independent NSCLC test datasets (GSE18842, GSE27262, 
      GSE19804) and achieved high accuracy, with an AUC-ROC of >0.99, >0.99, and 0.95, 
      respectively. Based on this study, a web application called NSCLCpred was 
      developed to predict NSCLC.

TI  - Identification of the Transcriptional Regulatory Role of RUNX2 by Network 
      Analysis in Lung Cancer Cells.
LID - 10.3390/biomedicines10123122 [doi]
LID - 3122
AB  - The use of a new bioinformatics pipeline allowed the identification of 
      deregulated transcription factors (TFs) coexpressed in lung cancer that could 
      become biomarkers of tumor establishment and progression. A gene regulatory 
      network (GRN) of lung cancer was created with the normalized gene expression 
      levels of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from the microarray dataset 
      GSE19804. Moreover, coregulatory and transcriptional regulatory network (TRN) 
      analyses were performed for the main regulators identified in the GRN analysis. 
      The gene targets and binding motifs of all potentially implicated regulators were 
      identified in the TRN and with multiple alignments of the TFs' target gene 
      sequences. Six transcription factors (E2F3, FHL2, ETS1, KAT6B, TWIST1, and RUNX2) 
      were identified in the GRN as essential regulators of gene expression in 
      non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and related to the lung tumoral process. Our 
      findings indicate that RUNX2 could be an important regulator of the lung cancer 
      GRN through the formation of coregulatory complexes with other TFs related to the 
      establishment and progression of lung cancer. Therefore, RUNX2 could become an 
      essential biomarker for developing diagnostic tools and specific treatments 
      against tumoral diseases in the lung after the experimental validation of its 
      regulatory function.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Through the bioinformatics analysis to screen out the potential 
      chromatin regulators (CRs) under the immune infiltration of osteoarthritis (OA), 
      thus providing some theoretical support for future studies of epigenetic 
      mechanisms under OA immune infiltration. METHODS: By integrating CRs and the OA 
      gene expression matrix, we performed weighted gene co-expression network analysis 
      (WGCNA), differential analysis, and further screened Hub genes by protein-protein 
      interaction (PPI) analysis. Using the OA gene expression matrix, immune 
      infiltration extraction and quantification were performed to analyze the 
      correlations and differences between immune infiltrating cells and their 
      functions. By virtue of these Hub genes, Hub gene association analysis was 
      completed and their upstream miRNAs were predicted by the FunRich software. 
      Moreover, a risk model was established to analyze the risk probability of 
      associated CRs in OA, and the confidence of the results was validated by the 
      validation dataset. RESULTS: This research acquired a total of 32 overlapping 
      genes, and 10 Hub genes were further identified. The strongest positive 
      correlation between dendritic cells and mast cells and the strongest negative 
      correlation between parainflammation and Type I IFN reponse. In the OA group DCs, 
      iDCs, macrophages, MCs, APC co-inhibition, and CCR were significantly increased, 
      whereas B cells, NK cells, Th2 cells, TIL, and T cell co-stimulation were 
      significantly decreased. The risk model results revealed that BRD1 might be an 
      independent risk factor for OA, and the validation dataset results are consistent 
      with it. 60 upstream miRNAs of OA-related CRs were predicted by the FunRich 
      software. CONCLUSION: This study identified certain potential CRs and miRNAs that 
      could regulate OA immunity, thus providing certain theoretical supports for 
      future epigenetic mechanism studies on the immune infiltration of OA.

      cells, respectively. As the cells resident in the AP and the PP possess stem cell 
      attributes, both antler generation and regeneration are stem cell-based 
      processes. However, the cell composition of each tissue type and molecular events 
      underlying antler development remain poorly characterized. Here, we took the 
      approach of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) and identified eight cell 
      types (mainly THY1(+) cells, progenitor cells, and osteochondroblasts) and three 
      core subclusters of the THY1(+) cells (SC2, SC3, and SC4). Endothelial and mural 
      cells each are heterogeneous at transcriptional level. It was the proliferation 
      of progenitor, mural, and endothelial cells in the activated 
      antler-lineage-specific tissues that drove the rapid formation of the antler. We 
      detected the differences in the initial differentiation process between antler 
      generation and regeneration using pseudotime trajectory analysis. These may be 
      due to the difference in the degree of stemness of the AP-THY1(+) and PP-THY1(+) 
      cells. We further found that androgen-RXFP2 axis may be involved in triggering 
      initial antler full regeneration. Fully deciphering the cell composition for 
      these antler tissue types will open up new avenues for elucidating the mechanism 
      underlying antler full renewal in specific and regenerative medicine in general.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and diabetes mellitus (DM) are two major 
      diseases threatening human health. The susceptibility of DM patients to COVID-19 
      and their worse outcomes have forced us to explore efficient routes to combat 
      COVID-19/DM. As the most active form of Vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D 
      (1,25(OH)(2)D) has been shown a beneficial effect in the treatment of 
      COVID-19/DM. However, the anti-COVID-19/DM mechanisms of 1,25(OH)(2)D remain 
      unclear. In this study, an approach combining network pharmacology and molecular 
      docking was performed to reveal the potential hub target genes and underlying 
      mechanisms of 1,25(OH)(2)D in the treatment of COVID-19/DM. The hub targets and 
      interaction pathways related to 1,25(OH)(2)D were identified by integrating the 
      key 1,25(OH)(2)D-target-signaling pathway-COVID-19/DM networks. Fifteen hub 
      targets of 1,25(OH)(2)D against COVID-19DM were determined, including EGFR, 
      PIK3R1, PIK3CA, STAT3, MAPK1, ESR1, HSP90AA1, LCK, MTOR, IGF1, AR, NFKB1, PIK3CB, 
      PTPN1, and MAPK14. An enrichment analysis of the hub targets further revealed 
      that the effect of 1,25(OH)(2)D against COVID-19/DM involved multiple biological 
      processes, cellular components, molecular functions and biological signaling 
      pathways. Molecular docking disclosed that 1,25(OH)(2)D docked nicely with the 
      hub target proteins, including EGFR, PIK3R1, and PIK3CA. These findings suggested 
      that the potential mechanisms of 1,25(OH)(2)D against COVID-19/DM may be related 
      to multiple biological targets and biological signaling pathways.

TI  - NEB mutations disrupt the super-relaxed state of myosin and remodel the muscle 
      metabolic proteome in nemaline myopathy.
PG  - 185
LID - 10.1186/s40478-022-01491-9 [doi]

AB  - Nemaline myopathy (NM) is one of the most common non-dystrophic genetic muscle 
      disorders. NM is often associated with mutations in the NEB gene. Even though the 
      exact NEB-NM pathophysiological mechanisms remain unclear, histological analyses 
      of patients' muscle biopsies often reveal unexplained accumulation of glycogen 
      and abnormally shaped mitochondria. Hence, the aim of the present study was to 
      define the exact molecular and cellular cascade of events that would lead to 
      potential changes in muscle energetics in NEB-NM. For that, we applied a wide 
      range of biophysical and cell biology assays on skeletal muscle fibres from NM 
      patients as well as untargeted proteomics analyses on isolated myofibres from a 
      muscle-specific nebulin-deficient mouse model. Unexpectedly, we found that the 
      myosin stabilizing conformational state, known as super-relaxed state, was 
      significantly impaired, inducing an increase in the energy (ATP) consumption of 
      resting muscle fibres from NEB-NM patients when compared with controls or with 
      other forms of genetic/rare, acquired NM. This destabilization of the myosin 
      super-relaxed state had dynamic consequences as we observed a remodeling of the 
      metabolic proteome in muscle fibres from nebulin-deficient mice. Altogether, our 
      findings explain some of the hitherto obscure hallmarks of NM, including the 
      appearance of abnormal energy proteins and suggest potential beneficial effects 
      of drugs targeting myosin activity/conformations for NEB-NM.

TI  - The Alarmone Diadenosine Tetraphosphate as a Cosubstrate for Protein AMPylation.
PG  - e202213279
LID - 10.1002/anie.202213279 [doi]
LID - e202213279
AB  - Diadenosine polyphosphates (Ap(n) As) are non-canonical nucleotides whose 
      cellular concentrations increase during stress and are therefore termed 
      alarmones, signaling homeostatic imbalance. Their cellular role is poorly 
      understood. In this work, we assessed Ap(n) As for their usage as cosubstrates 
      for protein AMPylation, a post-translational modification in which adenosine 
      monophosphate (AMP) is transferred to proteins. In humans, AMPylation mediated by 
      the AMPylator FICD with ATP as a cosubstrate is a response to ER stress. Herein, 
      we demonstrate that Ap(4) A is proficiently consumed for AMPylation by FICD. By 
      chemical proteomics using a new chemical probe, we identified new potential 
      AMPylation targets. Interestingly, we found that AMPylation targets of FICD may 
      differ depending on the nucleotide cosubstrate. These results may suggest that 
      signaling at elevated Ap(4) A levels during cellular stress differs from when 
      Ap(4) A is present at low concentrations, allowing response to extracellular 
      cues.

TI  - Variation of DNA methylation on the IRX1/2 genes is responsible for the neural 
      differentiation propensity in human induced pluripotent stem cells.
PG  - 620-630

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) are useful tools for 
      reproducing neural development in vitro. However, each hiPSC line has a different 
      ability to differentiate into specific lineages, known as differentiation 
      propensity, resulting in reduced reproducibility and increased time and funding 
      requirements for research. To overcome this issue, we searched for predictive 
      signatures of neural differentiation propensity of hiPSCs focusing on DNA 
      methylation, which is the main modulator of cellular properties. METHODS: We 
      obtained 32 hiPSC lines and their comprehensive DNA methylation data using the 
      Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip. To assess the neural differentiation 
      efficiency of these hiPSCs, we measured the percentage of neural stem cells on 
      day 7 of induction. Using the DNA methylation data of undifferentiated hiPSCs and 
      their measured differentiation efficiency into neural stem cells as the set of 
      data, and HSIC Lasso, a machine learning-based nonlinear feature selection 
      method, we attempted to identify neural differentiation-associated differentially 
      methylated sites. RESULTS: Epigenome-wide unsupervised clustering cannot 
      distinguish hiPSCs with varying differentiation efficiencies. In contrast, HSIC 
      Lasso identified 62 CpG sites that could explain the neural differentiation 
      efficiency of hiPSCs. Features selected by HSIC Lasso were particularly enriched 
      within 3 Mbp of chromosome 5, harboring IRX1, IRX2, and C5orf38 genes. Within 
      this region, DNA methylation rates were correlated with neural differentiation 
      efficiency and were negatively correlated with gene expression of the IRX1/2 
      genes, particularly in female hiPSCs. In addition, forced expression of the 
      IRX1/2 impaired the neural differentiation ability of hiPSCs in both sexes. 
      CONCLUSION: We for the first time showed that the DNA methylation state of the 
      IRX1/2 genes of hiPSCs is a predictive biomarker of their potential for neural 
      differentiation. The predictive markers for neural differentiation efficiency 
      identified in this study may be useful for the selection of suitable 
      undifferentiated hiPSCs prior to differentiation induction.

AB  - Regulation of the immune response to Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. 
      Typhimurium) infection is a complex process, influenced by the interaction 
      between genetic and environmental factors. Different inbred strains of mice 
      exhibit distinct levels of resistance to S. Typhimurium infection, ranging from 
      susceptible (e.g., C57BL/6J) to resistant (e.g., DBA/2J) strains. However, the 
      underlying molecular mechanisms contributing to the host response remain elusive. 
      In this study, we present a comprehensive proteomics profiling of spleen tissue 
      from C57BL/6J and DBA/2J strains with different doses of S. Typhimurium infection 
      by tandem mass tag labeling coupled with two-dimensional liquid 
      chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (TMT-LC/LC-MS/MS). We identified and 
      quantified 3,986 proteins, resulting in 475 differentially expressed proteins 
      (DEPs) between C57BL/6J and DBA/2J strains. Functional enrichment analysis 
      unveiled that the mechanisms of innate immune responses to S. Typhimurium 
      infection could be associated with several signaling pathways, including the 
      interferon (IFN) signaling pathway. We experimentally validated the roles of the 
      IFN signaling pathway in the innate immune response to S. Typhimurium infection 
      using an IFN-γ neutralization assay. We further illustrated the importance of 
      macrophage and proinflammatory cytokines in the mechanisms underlying the 
      resistance to S. Typhimurium using quantitative reverse transcription-PCR 
      (qRT-PCR). Taken together, our results provided new insights into the genetic 
      regulation of the immune response to S. Typhimurium infection in mice and might 
      lead to the discovery of potential protein targets for controlling salmonellosis.

TI  - Systemic analysis of the expression and prognostic significance of USP31 in 
      endometrial cancer.
PG  - 426-436
LID - 10.17305/bjbms.2022.8440 [doi]
AB  - Increasing evidence indicates that multiple mechanisms are involved in the 
      metastasis and postoperative recurrence in patients with endometrial cancer (EC). 
      Ubiquitin-specific protease 31 (USP31) has been studied in some human tumors, but 
      its function remains unclear in EC. In this study, we tried to investigate the 
      expression of USP31 in EC and its possible involvement in biological signaling 
      pathways and define its predictive value for the prognosis. Data from The Cancer 
      Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Genotype Tissue Expression (GTEx) databases confirmed the 
      difference in USP31 expression between EC and normal endometrium. Specimens and 
      clinical data of 259 patients with EC who underwent primary surgery at the First 
      Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University were collected. The 
      independent predictive value of USP31 for the prognosis of EC patients was 
      determined by univariate and multivariate analyses. Kaplan-Meier analysis and 
      receiver operating characteristic curves were used for confirming the ability of 
      USP31 to predict the prognosis. Functional enrichment analyses were used for 
      finding the hub genes associated with USP31 and to predict the biological 
      signaling pathways that might be involved. Our study confirms that EC patients 
      with low expression of USP31 may have a worse prognosis. Functional annotations 
      suggest that USP31 may participate in the mitogen-activated protein kinase 
      signaling pathway, nuclear factor κB pathway, early 2 factor targets, and 
      inflammatory response. USP31 may act as a promising biomarker for research in EC.

AB  - The fruit fly Drosophila is an excellent model to study the response of different 
      immunocompetent organs during systemic infection. In the present study, we 
      intended to test the hypothesis that the only professional immune organs of the 
      fly, the fat body and hemocytes, show substantial similarities in their responses 
      to systemic infection. However, comprehensive transcriptome analysis of isolated 
      organs revealed highly divergent transcript signatures, with the few commonly 
      regulated genes encoding mainly classical immune effectors from the antimicrobial 
      peptide family. The fat body and the hemocytes each have specific reactions that 
      are not present in the other organ. Fat body-specific responses comprised those 
      enabling an improved peptide synthesis and export. This reaction is accompanied 
      by transcriptomic shifts enabling the use of the energy resources of the fat body 
      more efficiently. Hemocytes, on the other hand, showed enhanced signatures 
      related to phagocytosis. Comparing immune-induced signatures of both cell types 
      with those of whole-body responses showed only a minimal correspondence, mostly 
      restricted again to antimicrobial peptide genes. In summary, the two major 
      immunocompetent cell types of Drosophila show highly specific responses to 
      infection, which are closely linked to the primary function of the respective 
      organ in the landscape of the systemic immune response.

AB  - Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitides (AAVs) are 
      closely associated with neutrophil recruitment and activation, but the impact of 
      the neutrophil apoptosis process in autoimmune disease has been rarely explained. 
      Here, by integrating and analyzing single-cell transcriptome datasets, we found 
      that the caspase-8-associated pathway in neutrophils was highly activated in the 
      kidney rather than in the blood. To verify the function of caspase-8 in 
      neutrophils on AAVs progression, we constructed neutrophil-specific caspase-8 
      knockout mice combined with an AAVs model induced by human ANCA from AAVs 
      patients, a rapid and powerful model developed in this study. Our results show 
      that caspase-8 activation of neutrophils up-regulates the expression of several 
      inflammatory and immunoregulatory factors, especially IL23A, regulating the 
      activation and differentiation of tissue-resident CD4(+) effector memory T cells. 
      This study reveals that the activation of caspase-8 in neutrophils can worsen 
      glomerulonephritis of AAVs by regulating inflammation and immunity.

TI  - Correlation of Transcriptomics and FDG-PET SUVmax Indicates Reciprocal Expression 
      of Stemness-Related Transcription Factor and Neuropeptide Signaling Pathways in 
      Glucose Metabolism of Ewing Sarcoma.
LID - 10.3390/cancers14235999 [doi]
LID - 5999
AB  - BACKGROUND: In Ewing sarcoma (EwS), long-term treatment effects and poor survival 
      rates for relapsed or metastatic cases require individualization of therapy and 
      the discovery of new treatment methods. Tumor glucose metabolic activity varies 
      significantly between patients, and FDG-PET signals have been proposed as 
      prognostic factors. However, the biological basis for the generally elevated but 
      variable glucose metabolism in EwS is not well understood. METHODS: We 
      retrospectively included 19 EwS samples (17 patients). Affymetrix gene expression 
      was correlated with maximal standardized uptake value (SUVmax) using machine 
      learning, linear regression modelling, and gene set enrichment analyses for 
      functional annotation. RESULTS: Expression of five genes correlated (MYBL2, 
      ELOVL2, NETO2) or anticorrelated (FAXDC2, PLSCR4) significantly with SUVmax 
      (adjusted p-value ≤ 0.05). Additionally, we identified 23 genes with large SUVmax 
      effect size, which were significantly enriched for "neuropeptide Y receptor 
      activity (GO:0004983)" (adjusted p-value = 0.0007). The expression of the members 
      of this signaling pathway (NPY, NPY1R, NPY5R) anticorrelated with SUVmax. In 
      contrast, three transcription factors associated with maintaining stemness 
      displayed enrichment of their target genes with higher SUVmax: RNF2, E2F family, 
      and TCF3. CONCLUSION: Our large-scale analysis examined comprehensively the 
      correlations between transcriptomics and tumor glucose utilization. Based on our 
      findings, we hypothesize that stemness may be associated with increased glucose 
      uptake, whereas neuroectodermal differentiation may anticorrelate with glucose 
      uptake.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is becoming a major 
      public health burden worldwide. It is urgent to explore more effective and safer 
      treatment strategy for COPD. Notably, Xuefu Zhuyu Decoction (XFZYD) is widely 
      used to treat respiratory system diseases, including COPD, in China. OBJECTIVE: 
      This study is aimed at comprehensively evaluating the therapeutic effects and 
      molecular mechanism of XFZYD on COPD. METHODS: Original clinical studies were 
      searched from eight literature databases. Meta-analysis was conducted using the 
      Review Manager software (version 5.4.1). Network pharmacology and molecular 
      docking experiments were utilized to explore the mechanisms of action of XFZYD. 
      RESULTS: XFZYD significantly enhanced the efficacy of clinical treatment and 
      improved the pulmonary function and hypoventilation of COPD patients. In 
      addition, XFZYD significantly improved the hypercoagulability of COPD patients. 
      The subgroup analysis suggested that XFZYD exhibited therapeutic effects on both 
      stable and acute exacerbation of COPD. XFZYD exerted its therapeutic effects on 
      COPD through multicomponent, multitarget, and multipathway characteristics. The 
      intervention of the PI3K-AKT pathway may be the critical mechanism. CONCLUSION: 
      The application of XFZYD based on symptomatic relief and supportive treatment is 
      a promising clinical decision. More preclinical and clinical studies are still 
      needed to evaluate the safety and therapeutic effects of long-term use of XFZYD 
      on COPD.

TI  - Brown-Norway chromosome 1 mitigates the upregulation of proinflammatory pathways 
      in mTAL cells and subsequent age-related CKD in Dahl SS/JrHsdMcwi rats.
PG  - F193-F210
LID - 10.1152/ajprenal.00145.2022 [doi]
AB  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD) has a strong genetic component; however, the 
      underlying pathways are not well understood. Dahl salt-sensitive (SS)/Jr rats 
      spontaneously develop CKD with age and are used to investigate the genetic 
      determinants of CKD. However, there are currently several genetically diverse 
      Dahl SS rats maintained at various institutions and the extent to which some 
      exhibit age-related CKD is unclear. We assessed glomerulosclerosis (GS) and 
      tubulointerstitial fibrosis (TIF) in 3- and 6-mo-old male and female 
      SS/JrHsdMcwi, BN/NHsd/Mcwi [Brown-Norway (BN)], and consomic SS-Chr 1(BN)/Mcwi 
      (SS.BN1) rats, in which chromosome 1 from the BN rat was introgressed into the 
      genome of the SS/JrHsdMcwi rat. Rats were fed a 0.4% NaCl diet. GS (31 ± 3% vs. 
      7 ± 1%) and TIF (2.3 ± 0.2 vs. 0.5 ± 0.1) were significantly greater in 6-mo-old 
      compared with 3-mo-old SS/JrHsdMcwi rats, and CKD was exacerbated in males. GS 
      was minimal in 6- and 3-mo-old BN (3.9 ± 0.6% vs. 1.2 ± 0.4%) and SS.BN1 
      (2.4 ± 0.5% vs. 1.0 ± 0.3%) rats, and neither exhibited TIF. In SS/JrHsdMcwi and 
      SS.BN1 rats, mean arterial blood pressure was significantly greater in 6-mo-old 
      compared with 3-mo-old SS/JrHsdMcwi (162 ± 4 vs. 131 ± 2 mmHg) but not SS.BN1 
      (115 ± 2 vs. 116 ± 1 mmHg) rats. In 6-mo-old SS/JrHsdMcwi rats, blood pressure 
      was significantly greater in females. RNA-sequencing analysis revealed that 
      inflammatory pathways were upregulated in isolated medullary thick ascending 
      tubules in 7-wk-old SS/JrHsdMcwi rats, before the development of tubule 
      pathology, compared with SS.BN1 rats. In summary, SS/JrHsdMcwi rats exhibit 
      robust age-related progression of medullary thick ascending limb abnormalities, 
      CKD, and hypertension, and gene(s) on chromosome 1 have a major pathogenic role 
      in such changes.NEW & NOTEWORTHY This study shows that the robust age-related 
      progression of kidney disease in Dahl SS/JrHsdMcw rats maintained on a 
      normal-salt diet is abolished in consomic SS.BN1 rats. Evidence that medullary 
      thick ascending limb segments of SS/JrHsdMcw rats are structurally abnormal and 
      enriched in proinflammatory pathways before the development of protein casts 
      provides new insights into the pathogenesis of kidney disease in this model.

TI  - Pan-cancer surveys indicate cell cycle-related roles of primate-specific genes in 
      tumors and embryonic cerebrum.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite having been extensively studied, it remains largely unclear 
      why humans bear a particularly high risk of cancer. The antagonistic pleiotropy 
      hypothesis predicts that primate-specific genes (PSGs) tend to promote 
      tumorigenesis, while the molecular atavism hypothesis predicts that PSGs involved 
      in tumors may represent recently derived duplicates of unicellular genes. 
      However, these predictions have not been tested. RESULTS: By taking advantage of 
      pan-cancer genomic data, we find the upregulation of PSGs across 13 cancer types, 
      which is facilitated by copy-number gain and promoter hypomethylation. 
      Meta-analyses indicate that upregulated PSGs (uPSGs) tend to promote 
      tumorigenesis and to play cell cycle-related roles. The cell cycle-related uPSGs 
      predominantly represent derived duplicates of unicellular genes. We prioritize 15 
      uPSGs and perform an in-depth analysis of one unicellular gene-derived duplicate 
      involved in the cell cycle, DDX11. Genome-wide screening data and knockdown 
      experiments demonstrate that DDX11 is broadly essential across cancer cell lines. 
      Importantly, non-neutral amino acid substitution patterns and increased 
      expression indicate that DDX11 has been under positive selection. Finally, we 
      find that cell cycle-related uPSGs are also preferentially upregulated in the 
      highly proliferative embryonic cerebrum. CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with the 
      predictions of the atavism and antagonistic pleiotropy hypotheses, 
      primate-specific genes, especially those PSGs derived from cell cycle-related 
      genes that emerged in unicellular ancestors, contribute to the early 
      proliferation of the human cerebrum at the cost of hitchhiking by similarly 
      highly proliferative cancer cells.

AB  - To date, very few mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics studies are available 
      on the anterior and posterior lobes of the pituitary. In the past, MS-based 
      investigations have focused exclusively on the whole pituitary gland or anterior 
      pituitary lobe. In this study, for the first time, we performed a deep MS-based 
      analysis of five anterior and five posterior matched lobes to build the first 
      lobe-specific pituitary proteome map, which documented 4090 proteins with 
      isoforms, mostly mapped into chromosomes 1, 2, and 11. About 1446 differentially 
      expressed significant proteins were identified, which were studied for lobe 
      specificity, biological pathway enrichment, protein-protein interaction, regions 
      specific to comparison of human brain and other neuroendocrine glands from Human 
      Protein Atlas to identify pituitary-enriched proteins. Hormones specific to each 
      lobe were also identified and validated with parallel reaction monitoring-based 
      target verification. The study identified and validated hormones, growth hormone 
      and thyroid-stimulating hormone subunit beta, exclusively to the anterior lobe 
      whereas oxytocin-neurophysin 1 and arginine vasopressin to the posterior lobe. 
      The study also identified proteins POU1F1 (pituitary-specific positive 
      transcription factor 1), POMC (pro-opiomelanocortin), PCOLCE2 (procollagen 
      C-endopeptidase enhancer 2), and NPTX2 (neuronal pentraxin-2) as 
      pituitary-enriched proteins and was validated for their lobe specificity using 
      parallel reaction monitoring. In addition, three uPE1 proteins, namely THEM6 
      (mesenchymal stem cell protein DSCD75), FSD1L (coiled-coil domain-containing 
      protein 10), and METTL26 (methyltransferase-like 26), were identified using the 
      NeXtProt database, and depicted tumor markers S100 proteins having high 
      expression in the posterior lobe. In summary, the study documents the first 
      matched anterior and posterior pituitary proteome map acting as a reference 
      control for a better understanding of functional and nonfunctional pituitary 
      adenomas and extrapolating the aim of the Human Proteome Project towards the 
      investigation of the proteome of life.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of death from 
      cardiovascular disease and has become an important public health problem 
      worldwide. Guizhi Gancao Decoction (GGD) has been shown to be used in the 
      treatment of CHD with good efficacy, but its specific therapeutic mechanism and 
      active ingredients have not been fully clarified. This study aims to identify the 
      active compounds and key targets of GGD in the treatment of CHD, explore the 
      therapeutic mechanism of GGD, and provide candidate compounds for anti-CHD drug 
      development. METHODS: The main compounds of GGD were determined by UPLC-MS/MS 
      analysis and screened by SwissADME. The corresponding targets of GGD compounds 
      were obtained from SwissTargetPrediction, and the targets of CHD were obtained 
      from the HERB and GeneCards databases. The STRING 11.5 database was used to 
      analyze the PPI (Protein-Protein Interactions) network of potential therapeutic 
      targets of GGD compounds. Cytoscape 3.7.2 was used to construct target-related 
      networks and find core targets. The GEO database was used to validate the 
      differential expression of core targets. The PANTHER Classification System was 
      used to functionally classify potential therapeutic targets for GGD. The GO 
      biological process analysis and KEGG pathway analysis of targets were completed 
      by DAVID 6.8 database. AutoDockTools 1.5.6 and PyMol 2.5.2 were used to perform 
      molecular docking of core targets with the active GGD compounds. RESULTS: 7 
      active GGD compounds were obtained based on UPLC-MS/MS and pharmacological 
      parameter evaluation, which corresponded to 131 CHD-related targets. Among them, 
      EGFR, MAPK3, RELA, CCND1, ESR1, PTGS2, NR3C1, CYP3A4, MMP9, and PTPN11 were 
      considered core targets. According to the targets related to CHD, glycyrrhetinic 
      acid, liquiritigenin, and schisandrin are considered key active ingredients. GO 
      biological process and KEGG analysis indicated that the potential targets of GGD 
      in the treatment of CHD involve a variety of biological processes and therapeutic 
      mechanisms. Molecular docking results showed that both the core targets and the 
      corresponding compounds had the good binding ability. CONCLUSIONS: This study 
      contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of the therapeutic mechanism 
      and active ingredients of GGD for CHD and provides candidate compounds for drug 
      development of CHD.

AB  - Nuclear organisation and architecture are essential for the maintenance of 
      genomic integrity as well as for the epigenetic regulations and gene expression. 
      Disruption of lamin B1, major structural and functional member of the nuclear 
      lamina, is observed in human laminopathies and in sporadic cancers, and leads to 
      chromosomal rearrangements and alterations of gene expression. The tumour 
      suppressor p53 has been shown to direct specific transcriptional programmes by 
      regulating lamin A/C, however its relationship with lamin B1 has remained 
      elusive. Here, we show that loss of p53 correlates with increased expression of 
      members belonging to the nuclear pore complex and nuclear lamina and directly 
      regulates transcription of lamin B1. We show that the genomic loci of a fraction 
      of p53-dependent genes physically interact with lamin B1 and Nup210. This 
      observation provides a possible mechanistic explanation for the p53-depedent 
      changes of chromatin accessibility, with the consequent influence of expression 
      and rearrangement of these genomic sites in pancreatic cancer. Overall, these 
      data suggest a potential functional and biochemical regulatory network connecting 
      p53 and nuclear architecture.

TI  - PGCLCs of human 45,XO reveal pathogenetic pathways of neurocognitive and

AB  - BACKGROUND: Neurocognitive disorders and psychosocial difficulties are common in 
      patients with Turner syndrome and multiple neurodegenerative diseases, yet there 
      is no effective cure. Human primordial germ cells (hPGCs) are pluripotent 
      germline stem cells in early embryo, which pass genetic information from one 
      generation to the next, whereas all somatic cells will die along with the end of 
      life. However, it is not known whether patient hPGCs with Turner syndrome contain 
      information of neurocognitive and psychosocial illness. RESULTS: In this report, 
      we used a high-density of culture system of embryoids derived from iPSCs of 
      a patient with Turner syndrome to ask how pathogenetic pathways are associated 
      with onset of neurocognitive and psychosocial disorders. The hPGC-Like Cells 
      (hPGCLCs) were in vitro specified from iPSCs of 45,XO, 46,XX and 46,XY by the 
      high-density induction of embryoids. Amazingly, we found that the specification 
      process of the hPGCLCs in 45,XO, compared to those in 46,XX and 46,XY, enriched 
      several common pathogenetic pathways regulating neurocognitive and psychosocial 
      disorders, that shared among multiple neurodegenerative diseases and Turner 
      syndrome. The downregulated chemical synaptic transmission pathways, including 
      glutamatergic, GABAergic, and nicotine cholinergic synapses, indicated synaptic 
      dysfunctions, while upregulated pathways that were associated with imbalance of 
      mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes and apoptosis, may contribute to 
      neuronal dysfunctions. Notably, downregulation of three types of ubiquitin 
      ligases E1-E2-E3 and lysosome-associated sulfatases and RAB9A, owing to 
      haploinsufficiency and parental preference of the X chromosome expression, 
      indicated that two pathways of cellular degradation, lysosome and 
      ubiquitin-proteasome, were impaired in the specification process of 45,XO 
      hPGCLCs. This would lead to accumulation of undesired proteins and aggregates, 
      which is a typically pathological hallmark in neurodegenerative diseases. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the specification process of the hPGCLCs in 
      45,XO, compared to those in 46,XX and 46,XY, enriched pathogenetic pathways that 
      are associated with the onset of neurocognitive and psychosocial disorders.

AB  - Dysfunction of neuronal nitric oxide synthase contributes to neurotoxicity, which 
      triggers cell death in various neuropathological diseases, including epilepsy. 
      Studies have shown that inhibition of neuronal nitric oxide synthase activity 
      increases the epilepsy threshold, that is, has an anticonvulsant effect. However, 
      the exact role and potential mechanism of neuronal nitric oxide synthase in 
      seizures are still unclear. In this study, we performed RNA sequencing, 
      functional enrichment analysis, and weighted gene coexpression network analysis 
      of the hippocampus of tremor rats, a rat model of genetic epilepsy. We found 
      damaged hippocampal mitochondria and abnormal succinate dehydrogenase level and 
      Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase activity. In addition, we used a pilocarpine-induced N2a cell 
      model to mimic epileptic injury. After application of neuronal nitric oxide 
      synthase inhibitor 7-nitroindazole, changes in malondialdehyde, lactate 
      dehydrogenase and superoxide dismutase, which are associated with oxidative 
      stress, were reversed, and the increase in reactive oxygen species level was 
      reversed by 7-nitroindazole or reactive oxygen species inhibitor 
      N-acetylcysteine. Application of 7-nitroindazole or N-acetylcysteine 
      downregulated the expression of caspase-3 and cytochrome c and reversed the 
      apoptosis of epileptic cells. Furthermore, 7-nitroindazole or N-acetylcysteine 
      downregulated the abnormally high expression of NLRP3, gasdermin-D, 
      interleukin-1β and interleukin-18. This indicated that 7-nitroindazole and 
      N-acetylcysteine each reversed epileptic cell death. Taken together, our findings 
      suggest that the neuronal nitric oxide synthase/reactive oxygen species pathway 
      is involved in pyroptosis of epileptic cells, and inhibiting neuronal nitric 
      oxide synthase activity or its induced oxidative stress may play a 
      neuroprotective role in epilepsy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sitting at the interface of gene expression and host-pathogen 
      interaction, polymerase associated factor 1 complex (PAF1C) is a rising player in 
      the innate immune response. The complex localizes to the nucleus and associates 
      with chromatin to modulate RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) elongation of gene 
      transcripts. Performing this function at both proximal and distal regulatory 
      elements, PAF1C interacts with many host factors across such sites, along with 
      several microbial proteins during infection. Therefore, translating the ubiquity 
      of PAF1C into specific impacts on immune gene expression remains especially 
      relevant. RESULTS: Advancing past work, we treat PAF1 knockout cells with a slate 
      of immune stimuli to identify key trends in PAF1-dependent gene expression with 
      broad analytical depth. From our transcriptomic data, we confirm PAF1 is an 
      activator of traditional immune response pathways as well as other cellular 
      pathways correlated with pathogen defense. With this model, we employ 
      computational approaches to refine how PAF1 may contribute to both gene 
      activation and suppression. Specifically focusing on transcriptional motifs and 
      regulons, we predict gene regulatory elements strongly associated with PAF1, 
      including those implicated in an immune response. Overall, our results suggest 
      PAF1 is involved in innate immunity at several distinct axes of regulation. 
      CONCLUSIONS: By identifying PAF1-dependent gene expression across several 
      pathogenic contexts, we confirm PAF1C to be a key mediator of innate immunity. 
      Combining these transcriptomic profiles with potential regulatory networks 
      corroborates the previously identified functions of PAF1C. With this, we foster 
      new avenues for its study as a regulator of innate immunity, and our results will 
      serve as a basis for targeted study of PAF1C in future validation studies.

AB  - The development of metastasis severely reduces the life expectancy of patients 
      with colorectal cancer (CRC). Although loss of SMAD4 is a key event in CRC 
      progression, the resulting changes in biological processes in advanced disease 
      and metastasis are not fully understood. Here, we applied a multiomics approach 
      to a CRC organoid model that faithfully reflects the metastasis-supporting 
      effects of SMAD4 inactivation. We show that loss of SMAD4 results in decreased 
      differentiation and activation of pro-migratory and cell proliferation processes, 
      which is accompanied by the disruption of several key oncogenic pathways, 
      including the TGFβ, WNT, and VEGF pathways. In addition, SMAD4 inactivation leads 
      to increased secretion of proteins that are known to be involved in a variety of 
      pro-metastatic processes. Finally, we show that one of the factors that is 
      specifically secreted by SMAD4-mutant organoids─DKK3─reduces the antitumor 
      effects of natural killer cells (NK cells). Altogether, our data provide new 
      insights into the role of SMAD4 perturbation in advanced CRC.

AB  - We show that elevation of mitochondrial superoxide generation increases 
      Caenorhabditis elegans life span by enhancing a RAS-dependent ROS (reactive 
      oxygen species) signaling pathway (RDRS) that controls the expression of half of 
      the genome as well as animal composition and physiology. RDRS stimulation mimics 
      a program of change in gene expression that is normally observed at the end of 
      postembryonic development. We further show that RDRS is regulated by negative 
      feedback from the superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD-1)-dependent conversion of 
      superoxide into cytoplasmic hydrogen peroxide, which, in turn, acts on a 
      redox-sensitive cysteine (C118) of RAS. Preventing C118 oxidation by replacement 
      with serine, or mimicking oxidation by replacement with aspartic acid, leads to 
      opposite changes in the expression of the same large set of genes that is 
      affected when RDRS is stimulated by mitochondrial superoxide. The identities of 
      these genes suggest that stimulation of the pathway extends life span by boosting 
      turnover and repair while moderating damage from metabolic activity.

TI  - Thermostable Proteins from HaCaT Keratinocytes Identify a Wide Breadth of 
      Intrinsically Disordered Proteins and Candidates for Liquid-Liquid Phase 
      Separation.
LID - 10.3390/ijms232214323 [doi]
LID - 14323
AB  - Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) move through an ensemble of 
      conformations which allows multitudinous roles within a cell. Keratinocytes, the 
      predominant cell type in mammalian epidermis, have had only a few individual 
      proteins assessed for intrinsic disorder and its possible contribution to 
      liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), especially in regard to what functions or 
      structures these proteins provide. We took a holistic approach to keratinocyte 
      IDPs starting with enrichment via the isolation of thermostable proteins. The 
      keratinocyte protein involucrin, known for its resistance to heat denaturation, 
      served as a marker. It and other thermostable proteins were identified by liquid 
      chromatography tandem mass spectrometry and subjected to extensive bioinformatic 
      analysis covering gene ontology, intrinsic disorder, and potential for LLPS. 
      Numerous proteins unique to keratinocytes and other proteins with shared 
      expression in multiple cell types were identified to have IDP traits (e.g., 
      compositional bias, nucleic acid binding, and repeat motifs). Among 
      keratinocyte-specific proteins, many that co-assemble with involucrin into the 
      cell-specific structure known as the cornified envelope scored highly for 
      intrinsic disorder and potential for LLPS. This suggests intrinsic disorder and 
      LLPS are previously unrecognized traits for assembly of the cornified envelope, 
      echoing the contribution of intrinsic disorder and LLPS to more widely 
      encountered features such as stress granules and PML bodies.

TI  - Vitamin D Deficiency and COVID-19: A Biological Database Study on Pathways and 
      Gene-Disease Associations.
LID - 10.3390/ijms232214256 [doi]
LID - 14256
AB  - Vitamin D (VD) is a fat-soluble vitamin, and pivotal for maintaining health. 
      Several genetic markers have been related to a deficient VD status; these markers 
      could confer an increased risk to develop osteoporosis and other chronic 
      diseases. A VD deficiency could also be a determinant of a severe COVID-19 
      disease. This study aimed to interrogate genetic/biological databases on the 
      biological implications of a VD deficiency and its association with diseases, to 
      further explore its link with COVID-19. The genetic variants of both a VD 
      deficiency and COVID-19 were identified in the genome-wide association studies 
      (GWAS) catalog and other sources. We conducted enrichment analyses (considering 
      corrected p-values < 0.05 as statistically significant) of the pathways, and 
      gene-disease associations using tools, such as FUMA, REVIGO, DAVID and DisGeNET, 
      and databases, such as the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and 
      Gene Ontology (GO). There were 26 and 46 genes associated with a VD deficiency 
      and COVID-19, respectively. However, there were no genes shared between the two. 
      Genes related to a VD deficiency were involved in the metabolism of 
      carbohydrates, retinol, drugs and xenobiotics, and were associated with the 
      metabolic syndrome and related factors (obesity, hypertension and diabetes 
      mellitus), as well as with neoplasms. There were few enriched pathways and 
      disease connections for the COVID-19-related genes, among which some of the 
      aforementioned comorbidities were also present. In conclusion, genetic factors 
      that influence the VD levels in the body are most prominently associated with 
      nutritional and metabolic diseases. A VD deficiency in high-risk populations 
      could be therefore relevant in a severe COVID-19, underlining the need to examine 
      whether a VD supplementation could reduce the severity of this disease.

TI  - Assessment of RACGAP1 as a Prognostic and Immunological Biomarker in Multiple 
      Human Tumors: A Multiomics Analysis.
LID - 10.3390/ijms232214102 [doi]
LID - 14102
AB  - Several recent studies have pointed out that arc GTPase activating protein 1 
      (RACGAP1) is a putative oncogene in many human tumors. However, to date, no 
      pan-cancer analysis has been performed to study the different aspects of this 
      gene expression and behavior in tumor tissues. Here, we applied several 
      bioinformatics tools to perform a comprehensive analysis for RACGAP1. First, we 
      assessed the expression of RACGAP1 in several types of human tumors and tried to 
      correlate that with the stage of the tumors analyzed. We then performed a 
      survival analysis to study the correlation between RACGAP1 upregulation in tumors 
      and the clinical outcome. Additionally, we investigated the mutation forms, the 
      correlation with several immune cell infiltration, the phosphorylation status of 
      the interested protein in normal and tumor tissues, and the potential molecular 
      mechanisms of RACGAP1 in cancerous tissue. The results demonstrated that RACGAP1, 
      a highly expressed gene across several types of tumors, correlated with a poor 
      prognosis in several types of human cancers. Moreover, it was found that RACGAP1 
      affects the tumor immune microenvironment by influencing the infiltration level 
      of several immune cells. Collectively, the current study provides a comprehensive 
      overview of the oncogenic roles of RACGAP1, where our results nominate it as a 
      potential prognostic biomarker and a target for antitumor therapy development.

      studies published from inception to May 29, 2022. Differential expression 
      analysis and weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) were performed 
      to search for modules of genes most associated with cardiotoxicity. 
      Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis was then performed to identify 
      hub genes for the cardiotoxicity of nilotinib. Molecular docking was used to 
      analyze the effects of rosuvastatin and aspirin on these targets. RESULTS: 
      Patients treated with nilotinib as first-line treatment were associated with a 
      higher risk of CAE (OR = 3.43 [95% CI 2.77-4.25]), CAD (OR = 5.30 [95% CI 
      3.85-7.29]), ACS (OR 2.7 [95% CI 1.60-4.54]), CVA (OR 5.76 [95% CI 2.84-11.28]), 
      PAOD (OR 5.57 [95% CI 3.26-9.50]) and arrhythmia (OR 2.34 [1.17,4.67]) than those 
      treated with imatinib, while no significant difference was found in the risk of 
      HF (OR 1.40 [95% CI 0.42-4.69]) between the two groups. Patients who were treated 
      with more than 600 mg daily dosage of nilotinib or followed up for more than 5 
      years had a higher risk of ACS and CVA. IL6, CXCL8, CCL2, SOD2, NFKBIA, and BIRC3 
      were identified as the top 6 hub genes in the magenta module (human cardiomyocyte 
      samples) and were mainly enriched in the NOD-like receptor signaling pathway, 
      IL-17 signaling pathway, TNF signaling pathway, lipid and atherosclerosis 
      signaling pathway. TYROBP and CSF1R were identified as hub genes in the turquoise 
      module (liver samples from Mus musculus). GSEA results showed that type II 
      diabetes mellitus, B-cell receptor, apoptosis, insulin, natural killer cell 
      mediated cytotoxicity,mTOR, chemokine, and T-cell receptor signaling pathways 
      were related to the higher risk of atherosclerosis caused by nilotinib. 
      Rosuvastatin can effectively bind to most of the hub targets and proteins 
      enriched in the inflammatory pathways above. CONCLUSION: CML patients who start 
      with nilotinib have a higher risk of CAE than those with imatinib. 
      Atherosclerosis caused by the inflammatory response and glycolipid metabolism 
      disorder is the key mechanism of nilotinib cardiotoxicity. Rosuvastatin may be an 
      effective treatment for the cardiotoxicity of nilotinib.

AB  - Cancer hallmark genes and proteins orchestrate and drive carcinogenesis to a 
      large extent, therefore, it is important to study these features in different 
      cancer types to understand the process of tumorigenesis and discover measurable 
      indicators. We performed a pan-cancer analysis to map differentially interacting 
      hallmarks of cancer proteins (DIHCP). The TCGA transcriptome data associated with 
      12 common cancers were analyzed and the differential interactome algorithm was 
      applied to determine DIHCPs and DIHCP-centric modules (i.e., DIHCPs and their 
      interacting partners) that exhibit significant changes in their interaction 
      patterns between the tumor and control phenotypes. The diagnostic and prognostic 
      capabilities of the identified modules were assessed to determine the ability of 
      the modules to function as system biomarkers. In addition, the druggability of 
      the prognostic and diagnostic DIHCPs was investigated. As a result, we found a 
      total of 30 DIHCP-centric modules that showed high diagnostic or prognostic 
      performance in any of the 12 cancer types. Furthermore, from the 16 DIHCP-centric 
      modules examined, 29% of these were druggable. Our study presents candidate 
      systems' biomarkers that may be valuable for understanding the process of 
      tumorigenesis and improving personalized treatment strategies for various 
      cancers, with a focus on their ten hallmark characteristics.

TI  - Screening for Lipid-Metabolism-Related Genes and Identifying the Diagnostic

AB  - Lipid metabolic reprogramming is one of the hallmarks of hepatocarcinogenesis and 
      development. Therefore, lipid-metabolism-related genes may be used as potential 
      biomarkers for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study aimed to screen for 
      genes with dysregulated expression related to lipid metabolism in HCC and 
      explored the clinical value of these genes. We screened differentially expressed 
      proteins between tumorous and adjacent nontumorous tissues of hepatitis B virus 
      (HBV)-related HCC patients using a Nanoscale Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass 
      Spectrometry platform and combined it with transcriptomic data of 
      lipid-metabolism-related genes from the GEO and HPA databases to identify 
      dysregulated genes that may be involved in lipid metabolic processes. The 
      potential clinical values of these genes were explored by bioinformatics online 
      analysis tools (GEPIA, cBioPortal, SurvivalMeth, and TIMER). The expression 
      levels of the secreted protein (angiopoietin-like protein 6, ANGPTL6) in serum 
      were analyzed by ELISA. The ability of serum ANGPTL6 to diagnose early HCC was 
      assessed by ROC curves. The results showed that serum ANGPTL6 could effectively 
      differentiate between HBV-related early HCC patients with normal serum 
      alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels and the noncancer group (healthy participants and 
      chronic hepatitis B patients) (AUC = 0.717, 95% CI: from 0.614 to 0.805). Serum 
      ANGPTL6 can be used as a potential second-line biomarker to supplement serum AFP 
      in the early diagnosis of HBV-related HCC.

AB  - Structural changes and neuropathology in the hypothalamus have been suggested to 
      contribute to the non-motor manifestations of Huntington's disease (HD), a 
      neurodegenerative disorder caused by an expanded cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) 
      repeat in the huntingtin (HTT) gene. In this study, we investigated whether 
      hypothalamic HTT expression causes transcriptional changes. Hypothalamic RNA was 
      isolated from two different HD mouse models and their littermate controls; BACHD 
      mice with ubiquitous expression of full-length mutant HTT (mHTT) and wild-type 
      mice with targeted hypothalamic overexpression of either wild-type HTT (wtHTT) or 
      mHTT fragments. The mHTT and wtHTT groups showed the highest number of 
      differentially expressed genes compared to the BACHD mouse model. Gene Set 
      Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) with leading-edge analysis showed that suppressed 
      sterol- and cholesterol metabolism were shared between hypothalamic wtHTT and 
      mHTT overexpression. Most distinctive for mHTT overexpression was the suppression 
      of neuroendocrine networks, in which qRT-PCR validation confirmed significant 
      downregulation of neuropeptides with roles in feeding behavior; hypocretin 
      neuropeptide precursor (Hcrt), tachykinin receptor 3 (Tacr3), cocaine and 
      amphetamine-regulated transcript (Cart) and catecholamine-related biological 
      processes; dopa decarboxylase (Ddc), histidine decarboxylase (Hdc), tyrosine 
      hydroxylase (Th), and vasoactive intestinal peptide (Vip). In BACHD mice, few 
      hypothalamic genes were differentially expressed compared to age-matched WT 
      controls. However, GSEA indicated an enrichment of inflammatory- and 
      gonadotropin-related processes at 10 months. In conclusion, we show that both 
      wtHTT and mHTT overexpression change hypothalamic transcriptome profile, 
      specifically mHTT, altering neuroendocrine circuits. In contrast, the ubiquitous 
      expression of full-length mHTT in the BACHD hypothalamus moderately affects the 
      transcriptomic profile.

AB  - SIRT3 deacetylates mitochondrial proteins, thereby enhancing their function. We 
      have previously demonstrated that Sirt3 gene deletion leads to brain 
      mitochondrial dysfunction and neuroinflammation. We also reported that silencing 
      of Sirt3 gene in APP/PS1 mice results in exacerbation of insulin resistance, 
      neuroinflammation and β amyloid plaque deposition. To further understand how 
      metabolic syndrome and amyloid pathology interact, we performed RNA-seq analysis 
      of the brain samples of APP/PS1/Sirt3(-/-) mice. Gene expression patterns were 
      modulated in metabolic and inflammatory pathways by Sirt3 gene deletion, amyloid 
      pathology, and the combination. Following Sirt3 gene deletion, a key finding was 
      the decreased expression of insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE), an enzyme that 
      regulates the levels of insulin and Aβ peptides. Western diet feeding of 
      Sirt3(-/-) and APP/PS1 mice resulted in decrease of IDE protein, parallel to 
      Sirt3 downregulation. Conversely, activation of SIRT3 by nicotinamide riboside in 
      vivo and in vitro resulted in IDE upregulation. SIRT3 activation in vivo also 
      increased the levels of neprilysin, another Aβ degrading enzyme and decreased the 
      levels of BACE1 which generates Aβ peptide suggesting SIRT3's role in amyloid 
      plaque reduction. Our findings provide a plausible mechanism linking metabolic 
      syndrome and amyloid pathology. SIRT3 may be a potential therapeutic target to 
      treat AD.

AB  - The on-going COVID-19 pandemic has given rise to SARS-CoV-2 clades and variants 
      with differing levels of symptoms and severity. To this end, we aim to 
      systematically elucidate the changes in the pathogenesis as SARS-CoV-2 evolved 
      from ancestral to the recent Omicron VOC, on their mechanisms (e.g. cytokine 
      storm) resulting in tissue damage, using the established K18-hACE2 murine model. 
      We reported that among the SARS-CoV-2 viruses tested, infection profiles were 
      initially similar between viruses from early clades but started to differ greatly 
      starting from VOC Delta, where the trend continues in Omicron. VOCs Delta and 
      Omicron both accumulated a significant number of mutations, and when compared to 
      VOCs Alpha, Beta, and earlier predecessors, showed reduced neurotropism and less 
      apparent gene expression in cytokine storm associated pathways. They were shown 
      to leverage on other pathways to cause tissue damage (or lack of in the case of 
      Omicron). Our study highlighted the importance of elucidating the response 
      profiles of individual SARS-CoV-2 iterations, as their propensity of severe 
      infection via pathways like cytokine storm changes as more variant evolves. This 
      will then affect the overall threat assessment of each variant as well as the use 
      of immunomodulatory treatments as management of severe infections of each 
      variant.

AB  - Functional enrichment analysis or pathway enrichment analysis (PEA) is a 
      bioinformatics technique which identifies the most over-represented biological 
      pathways in a list of genes compared to those that would be associated with them 
      by chance. These biological functions are found on bioinformatics annotated 
      databases such as The Gene Ontology or KEGG; the more abundant pathways are 
      identified through statistical techniques such as Fisher's exact test. All PEA 
      tools require a list of genes as input. A few tools, however, read lists of 
      genomic regions as input rather than lists of genes, and first associate these 
      chromosome regions with their corresponding genes. These tools perform a 
      procedure called genomic regions enrichment analysis, which can be useful for 
      detecting the biological pathways related to a set of chromosome regions. In this 
      brief survey, we analyze six tools for genomic regions enrichment analysis 
      (BEHST, g:Profiler g:GOSt, GREAT, LOLA, Poly-Enrich, and ReactomePA), outlining 
      and comparing their main features. Our comparison results indicate that the 
      inclusion of data for regulatory elements, such as ChIP-seq, is common among 
      these tools and could therefore improve the enrichment analysis results.

TI  - Identification of candidate hub genes correlated with the pathogenesis, 
      diagnosis, and prognosis of prostate cancer by integrated bioinformatics 
      analysis.
PG  - 3548-3571
LID - 10.21037/tcr-22-703 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer (PCa) has the second highest morbidity and mortality 
      rates in men. Concurrently, novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers of PCa 
      remain crucial. METHODS: This study utilized integrated bioinformatics method to 
      identify and validate the potential hub genes with high diagnostic and prognostic 
      value for PCa. RESULTS: Four Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets including 123 
      PCa samples and 76 normal samples were screened and a total of 368 differentially 
      expressed genes (DEGs), including 120 up-regulated DEGs and 248 down-regulated 
      DEGs, were identified. Subsequent Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of 
      Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis showed that the DEGs were majorly enriched in 
      focal adhesion, chemical carcinogenesis, drug metabolism, and cytochrome P450 
      pathways. Then, 11 hub genes were identified from the protein-protein interaction 
      (PPI) network of the DEGs; 7 of the 11 genes showed the ability of distinguishing 
      PCa from normal prostate based on receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve 
      analysis. And 5 of the 11 genes were correlated with clinical attributes. Lower 
      CAV1, KRT5, SNAI2 and MYLK expression level were associated with higer Gleason 
      score, advanced pathological T stage and N stage. Lower KRT5 and MYLK expression 
      level were significantly correlated with poor disease-free survival, and lower 
      KRT5 and PTGS2 expression level were significantly related to biochemical 
      recurrence (BCR) status of PCa patients. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, CAV1, KRT5, 
      SNAI2, and MYLK show potential clinical diagnostic and prognostic value and could 
      be used as novel candidate biomarkers and therapeutic targets for PCa.

TI  - Screening Key lncRNAs of Ankylosing Spondylitis Using Bioinformatics Analysis.
PG  - 6087-6096
LID - 10.2147/JIR.S387258 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are important regulators in ankylosing 
      spondylitis (AS). Few studies have examined the lncRNA-RNA binding protein (RBP) 
      interaction in AS. This study performed bioinformatics analysis and clinical 
      verification to identify key lncRNAs and propose their RBP interaction. METHODS: 
      Three GEO datasets of AS were analyzed by differential expression analysis. The 
      differentially expressed lncRNAs between the AS and control groups were screened 
      out, and the intersecting lncRNAs were regarded as target lncRNAs. Functional was 
      performed to identify target lncRNAs by enrichment analysis, co-expressed RNA 
      analysis, and lncRNA-RBP interaction analysis. Finally, this study analyzed the 
      differential expression level and clinical value of lncRNAs between the AS and 
      control groups. RESULTS: Linc00304, linc00926, and MIAT were differentially 
      expressed and upregulated. Enrichment analysis indicated that the key KEGG terms 
      were the T-cell receptor signaling pathway and B-cell receptor signaling pathway. 
      The key molecular function term was protein binding, and the key biological 
      process term was adaptive immune response. In qRT-PCR results, 44 samples were 
      validated. linc00304 expression was positively correlated with bath ankylosing 
      spondylitis disease activity index (BASDAI), bath ankylosing spondylitis 
      functional index (BASFI), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and c-reactive 
      protein (CRP). linc00926 expression was only positively correlated with ESR, 
      whereas MIAT expression was positively correlated with BASFI, ESR, and CRP. 
      Logistic regression revealed that linc00304, ESR, and CRP were the independent 
      risk factors for BASDAI activation. The area under the curve (AUC) of serum 
      linc00304 level in the diagnosis of AS was 0.687 (cutoff value: 0.413, 
      specificity: 0.423, sensitivity: 0.900). AUC of linc00926 was 0.664 (cutoff 
      value: 0.299, sensitivity: 0.882, specificity: 0.417). AUC of MIAT was 0.623 
      (cutoff value: 0.432, specificity: 0.443, sensitivity: 0.890) (all P <0.05). 
      CONCLUSION: Overall, this study uncovered three novel lncRNAs, which were 
      upregulated in AS, and proposed a new lncRNA-RBP-mRNA interaction that might 
      regulate adaptive immune response.

AB  - The Wnt-pathway has a critical role in development and tissue homeostasis and has 
      attracted increased attention to develop anticancer drugs due to its aberrant 
      activation in many cancers. In this study, we identified a novel small molecule 
      series with a thienopyrimidine scaffold acting as a downstream inhibitor of the 
      β-catenin-dependent Wnt-pathway. This novel chemotype was investigated using 
      Wnt-dependent triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines. Structure activity 
      relationship (SAR) exploration led to identification of low micromolar compounds 
      such as 5a, 5d, 5e and a novel series with quinazoline scaffold such as 9d. 
      Further investigation showed translation of activity to inhibit cancer survival 
      of HCC1395 and MDA-MB-468 TNBC cell lines without affecting a non-cancerous 
      breast epithelial cell line MCF10a. This anti-proliferative effect was 
      synergistic to docetaxel treatment. Collectively, we identified novel chemotypes 
      acting as a downstream inhibitor of β-catenin-dependent Wnt-pathway that could 
      expand therapeutic options to manage TNBC.

TI  - The CIC-ERF co-deletion underlies fusion-independent activation of ETS family 
      member, ETV1, to drive prostate cancer progression.
LID - 10.7554/eLife.77072 [doi]
LID - e77072
AB  - Human prostate cancer can result from chromosomal rearrangements that lead to 
      aberrant ETS gene expression. The mechanisms that lead to fusion-independent ETS 
      factor upregulation and prostate oncogenesis remain relatively unknown. Here, we 
      show that two neighboring transcription factors, Capicua (CIC) and ETS2 repressor 
      factor (ERF), which are co-deleted in human prostate tumors can drive prostate 
      oncogenesis. Concurrent CIC and ERF loss commonly occur through focal genomic 
      deletions at chromosome 19q13.2. Mechanistically, CIC and ERF co-bind the 
      proximal regulatory element and mutually repress the ETS transcription factor, 
      ETV1. Targeting ETV1 in CIC and ERF-deficient prostate cancer limits tumor 
      growth. Thus, we have uncovered a fusion-independent mode of ETS transcriptional 
      activation defined by concurrent loss of CIC and ERF.

TI  - Mitochondrial DNA haplogroup M7: A predictor of poor prognosis for colorectal 
      cancer patients in Chinese population.
PG  - 1056-1066
LID - 10.1111/cas.15654 [doi]
AB  - Haplogroups and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) of mitochondrial DNA 
      (mtDNA) were associated with the prognosis of many types of cancer patients. 
      However, whether mtDNA haplogroups contribute to clinical outcomes of colorectal 
      cancer (CRC) in Chinese population remains to be determined. In this study, mtDNA 
      of tissue samples from 445 CRC patients from Northwestern China was sequenced to 
      evaluate the association between haplogroup and prognosis. The mtDNA sequencing 
      data of 1015 CRC patients from Southern China were collected for validation. We 
      found patients with mtDNA haplogroup M7 had a significantly higher death risk 
      when compared with patients with other haplogroups in both Northwestern (Hazard 
      ratio [HR] = 3.093, 95% CI = 1.768-5.411, p < 0.001) and Southern (HR = 1.607, 
      95% CI = 1.050-2.459, p = 0.029) China. Then, a haplogroup M7-based mtSNP 
      classifier was selected by using LASSO Cox regression analysis. A nomogram 
      comprising the mtSNP classifier and clinicopathological variables was developed 
      to predict the prognosis of CRC patients (area under the curve [AUC] 0.735, 95% 
      CI = 0.679-0.791). Furthermore, patients with high- and low-risk scores 
      calculated by the haplogroup M7-based mtSNP classifier exhibited significantly 
      different overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) (all 
      p < 0.001). Finally, RNA-seq and immunohistochemical analyses indicated the poor 
      prognosis of patients with haplogroup M7 may be related to mitochondrial 
      dysfunction and immune abnormalities in CRC tissues. In conclusion, the 
      haplogroup M7 and haplogroup M7-based mtSNP classifier seems to be a practical 
      and reliable prognostic predictor for CRC patients, which provides a potential 
      tool of clinical decision-making for patients with haplogroup M7 in Chinese 
      population.

TI  - Analysis of Exosomal MicroRNA Dynamics in Response to Rhinovirus Challenge in a 
      Longitudinal Case-Control Study of Asthma.
LID - 10.3390/v14112444 [doi]
LID - 2444
AB  - Asthma symptoms are often exacerbated by the common-cold-causing rhinovirus (RV). 
      In this study, we characterized the temporal behavior of circulating exosomal 
      microRNAs (ExoMiRNAs) in a longitudinal bi-phasic case-control study of mild 
      asthmatics (n = 12) and matched non-atopic healthy controls (n = 12) inoculated 
      with rhinovirus. We aimed to define clinical and immunologic characteristics 
      associated with differentially expressed (DE) miRNAs. In total, 26 DE ExoMiRNAs, 
      including hsa-let-7f-5p, hsa-let-7a-5p, hsa-miR-122-5p, hsa-miR-101-3p, and 
      hsa-miR-126-3p, were identified between asthmatic and healthy subjects after 
      inoculation with RV. Time series clustering identified a unique Cluster of 
      Upregulated DE ExoMiRNAs with augmenting mean expression and a distinct Cluster 
      of Downregulated DE ExoMiRNAs with mean expression decline in asthmatic subjects 
      upon RV challenge. Notably, the Upregulated Cluster correlated with Th1 and 
      interferon-induced cytokines/chemokines (IFN-γ and IFN-γ-inducible protein-10) 
      and interleukin-10 (IL-10). Conversely, the Downregulated Cluster correlated with 
      IL-13, a Th2 cytokine, pulmonary function measurements (FVC%, FEV1%, and PEF%), 
      and inflammatory biomarkers (FeNO, eosinophil%, and neutrophil%). Key 
      ExoMiRNA-target gene and anti-viral defense mechanisms of the Upregulated and 
      Downregulated Clusters were identified by network and gene enrichment analyses. 
      Our findings provide insight into the regulatory role of ExoMiRNAs in RV-induced 
      asthma.

TI  - Transcriptomic Studies of Antidepressant Action in Rodent Models of Depression: A 
      First Meta-Analysis.
LID - 10.3390/ijms232113543 [doi]
LID - 13543
AB  - Antidepressants (ADs) are, for now, the best everyday treatment we have for 
      moderate to severe major depressive episodes (MDEs). ADs are among the most 
      prescribed drugs in the Western Hemisphere; however, the trial-and-error 
      prescription strategy and side-effects leave a lot to be desired. More than 60% 
      of patients suffering from major depression fail to respond to the first AD they 
      are prescribed. For those who respond, full response is only observed after 
      several weeks of treatment. In addition, there are no biomarkers that could help 
      with therapeutic decisions; meanwhile, this is already true in cancer and other 
      fields of medicine. For years, many investigators have been working to decipher 
      the underlying mechanisms of AD response. Here, we provide the first systematic 
      review of animal models. We thoroughly searched all the studies involving 
      rodents, profiling transcriptomic alterations consecutive to AD treatment in 
      naïve animals or in animals subjected to stress-induced models of depression. We 
      have been confronted by an important heterogeneity regarding the drugs and the 
      experimental settings. Thus, we perform a meta-analysis of the AD signature of 
      fluoxetine (FLX) in the hippocampus, the most studied target. Among genes and 
      pathways consistently modulated across species, we identify both old players of 
      AD action and novel transcriptional biomarker candidates that warrant further 
      investigation. We discuss the most prominent transcripts (immediate early genes 
      and activity-dependent synaptic plasticity pathways). We also stress the need for 
      systematic studies of AD action in animal models that span across sex, peripheral 
      and central tissues, and pharmacological classes.

TI  - The Stress Response of the Holothurian Central Nervous System: A Transcriptomic 
      Analysis.
LID - 10.3390/ijms232113393 [doi]
LID - 13393
AB  - Injury to the central nervous system (CNS) results in permanent damage and lack 
      of function in most vertebrate animals, due to their limited regenerative 
      capacities. In contrast, echinoderms can fully regenerate their radial nerve cord 
      (RNC) following transection, with little to no scarring. Investigators have 
      associated the regenerative capacity of some organisms to the stress response and 
      inflammation produced by the injury. Here, we explore the gene activation profile 
      of the stressed holothurian CNS. To do this, we performed RNA sequencing on 
      isolated RNC explants submitted to the stress of transection and enzyme 
      dissection and compared them with explants kept in culture for 3 days following 
      dissection. We describe stress-associated genes, including members of heat-shock 
      families, ubiquitin-related pathways, transposons, and apoptosis that were 
      differentially expressed. Surprisingly, the stress response does not induce 
      apoptosis in this system. Other genes associated with stress in other animal 
      models, such as hero proteins and those associated with the integrated stress 
      response, were not found to be differentially expressed either. Our results 
      provide a new viewpoint on the stress response in the nervous system of an 
      organism with amazing regenerative capacities. This is the first step in 
      deciphering the molecular processes that allow echinoderms to undergo fully 
      functional CNS regeneration, and also provides a comparative view of the stress 
      response in other organisms.

TI  - Bioinformatics Analysis and Validation of the Role of Lnc-RAB11B-AS1 in the 
      Development and Prognosis of Hepatocellular Carcinoma.
LID - 10.3390/cells11213517 [doi]
LID - 3517
AB  - Lnc-RAB11B-AS1 is reported to be dysregulated in several types of cancers and can 
      function as both an oncogene and tumor suppressor gene. To evaluate the potential 
      role of lnc-RAB11B-AS1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), we investigated and 
      evaluated its expression in HCC based on the data mining of a series of public 
      databases, including TCGA, GEO, ICGC, HPA, DAVID, cBioPortal, GeneMIANA, TIMER, 
      and ENCORI. The data showed downregulation of lnc-RAB11B-AS1 in HCC and was 
      accompanied by the synchronous downregulation of the targeted RAB11B mRNA and its 
      protein. Low expression of lnc-RAB11B-AS1 was associated with shorter overall 
      survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) of HCC patients, PD1/PD-L1 was 
      correlated with low expression of RAB11B. Furthermore, Gene Ontology (GO) 
      functional annotation and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway 
      enrichment analysis showed a correlation between immune cell change and 
      non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. The above findings revealed that 
      lnc-RAB11B-AS1 was down-regulated in HCC and closely associated with the clinical 
      stage of the HCC patients, suggesting that lnc-RAB11B-AS1 could be a possible 
      predictor for HCC and a potential new therapeutic target for the treatment of 
      HCC.

TI  - RT-qPCR Expression Profiles of Selected Oncogenic and Oncosuppressor miRNAs in 
      Formalin-Fixed, Paraffin-Embedded Canine Mammary Tumors.
LID - 10.3390/ani12212898 [doi]
LID - 2898
AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) can act as oncogenes or oncosuppressor genes, and their 
      involvement in nearly all cancer-associated processes makes these small molecules 
      promising diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers in cancer, as well as specific 
      targets for cancer therapy. This study aimed to investigate the expression of 7 
      miRNAs (miR-18a, miR-18b, miR-22, miR-124, miR-145, miR-21, miR-146b) in 
      formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded canine mammary tumors (CMTs) by quantitative 
      reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Twenty-six mammary 
      samples were selected, including 22 CMTs (7 benign; 15 malignant) and 4 control 
      samples (3 normal mammary gland and 1 case of lobular hyperplasia). Oncogenic 
      miR-18a, miR-18b and miR-21 were significantly upregulated in malignant tumors 
      compared with control tissues (p < 0.05). Conversely, oncosuppressor miR-146b was 
      significantly downregulated in benign and malignant mammary tumors compared with 
      control samples (p < 0.05) while, no group-related differences in the expression 
      levels of miR-22, miR-124 and miR-145 were found (p > 0.05). Upregulated miRNAs 
      found here, may regulate genes involved in receptor-mediated carcinogenesis and 
      proteoglycan remodeling in cancer; while miRNA with reduced expression can 
      regulate genes involved in Toll-like receptor and MAPK signaling pathways. 
      According to the results obtained in the current study, the oncogenic and 
      oncosuppressor miRNAs analyzed here are dysregulated in CMTs and the 
      dysregulation of miRNA targets may lead to specific altered cellular processes 
      and key pathways involved in carcinogenesis. Of note, since oncogenic miRNAs 
      predicted to regulate neoplastic cell proliferation and hormonal activities, they 
      may play an active role in neoplastic transformation and/or progression, having 
      mechanistic and prognostic relevance in CMTs.

      Trophoblast Outgrowth.

LID - 609
AB  - Porcine species have a great impact on studies on biomaterial production, organ 
      transplantation and the development of biomedical models. The low efficiency of 
      in vitro-produced embryos to derive embryonic stem cells has made achieving this 
      goal a challenge. The fallopian tube plays an important role in the development 
      of embryos. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) secreted by oviductal epithelial cells 
      play an important role in the epigenetic regulation of embryo development. We 
      used artificially isolated oviductal epithelial cells and EVs. In this study, 
      oviductal epithelial cell (OEC) EVs were isolated and characterized through 
      transmission electron microscopy, nanoparticles tracking analysis, western 
      blotting and proteomics. We found that embryo development and blastocyst 
      formation rate was significantly increased (14.3% ± 0.6% vs. 6.0% ± 0.6%) after 
      OEC EVs treatment. According to our data, the inner cell mass (ICM)/trophectoderm 
      (TE) ratio of the embryonic cell number increased significantly after OEC EVs 
      treatment (43.7% ± 2.3% vs. 28.4% ± 2.1%). Meanwhile, the attachment ability of 
      embryos treated with OEV EVs was significantly improved (43.5% ± 2.1% vs. 29.2% ± 
      2.5%, respectively). Using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), we 
      found that the expression of reprogramming genes (POU5F1, SOX2, NANOG, KLF4 and 
      c-Myc) and implantation-related genes (VIM, KRT8, TEAD4 and CDX2) significantly 
      increased in OEC EV-treated embryos. We report that OEC EV treatment can improve 
      the development and implantation abilities of embryos.

TI  - Immune Pathway and Gene Database (IMPAGT) Revealed the Immune Dysregulation

AB  - Tumor budding (TB) is a small cluster of malignant cells at the invasive front of 
      a tumor. Despite being an adverse prognosis marker, little research has been 
      conducted on the tumor immune microenvironment of tumor buddings, especially in 
      cervical cancer. Therefore, RNA sequencing was performed using 21 formalin-fixed, 
      paraffin-embedded slides of cervical tissues, and differentially expressed genes 
      (DEGs) were analyzed. Immune Pathway and Gene Database (IMPAGT) was generated for 
      immune profiling. "Pathway in Cancer" was identified as the most enriched pathway 
      for both up- and downregulated DEGs. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes 
      Mapper and Gene Ontology further revealed the activation of the PI3K/Akt 
      signaling pathway. An IMPAGT analysis revealed immune dysregulation even at the 
      tumor budding stage, especially in the PI3K/Akt/mTOR axis, with a high efficiency 
      and integrity. These findings emphasized the clinical significance of tumor 
      buddings and the necessity of blocking the overactivation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR 
      pathway to improve targeted therapy in cervical cancer.

TI  - Origins and Evolution of Human Tandem Duplicated Exon Substitution Events.
LID - 10.1093/gbe/evac162 [doi]
LID - evac162
AB  - The mutually exclusive splicing of tandem duplicated exons produces protein 
      isoforms that are identical save for a homologous region that allows for the fine 
      tuning of protein function. Tandem duplicated exon substitution events are rare, 
      yet highly important alternative splicing events. Most events are ancient, their 
      isoforms are highly expressed, and they have significantly more pathogenic 
      mutations than other splice events. Here, we analyzed the physicochemical 
      properties and functional roles of the homologous polypeptide regions produced by 
      the 236 tandem duplicated exon substitutions annotated in the human gene set. We 
      find that the most important structural and functional residues in these 
      homologous regions are maintained, and that most changes are conservative rather 
      than drastic. Three quarters of the isoforms produced from tandem duplicated exon 
      substitution events are tissue-specific, particularly in nervous and cardiac 
      tissues, and tandem duplicated exon substitution events are enriched in 
      functional terms related to structures in the brain and skeletal muscle. We find 
      considerable evidence for the convergent evolution of tandem duplicated exon 
      substitution events in vertebrates, arthropods, and nematodes. Twelve human gene 
      families have orthologues with tandem duplicated exon substitution events in both 
      Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans. Six of these gene families 
      are ion transporters, suggesting that tandem exon duplication in genes that 
      control the flow of ions into the cell has an adaptive benefit. The ancient 
      origins, the strong indications of tissue-specific functions, and the evidence of 
      convergent evolution suggest that these events may have played important roles in 
      the evolution of animal tissues and organs.

AB  - Extracellular matrixes (ECMs) are intricate 3-dimensional macromolecular networks 
      of unique architectures with regulatory roles in cell morphology and 
      functionality. As a dynamic native biomaterial, ECM undergoes constant but 
      tightly controlled remodeling that is crucial for the maintenance of normal 
      cellular behavior. Under pathological conditions like cancer, ECM remodeling 
      ceases to be subjected to control resulting in disease initiation and 
      progression. ECM is comprised of a staggering number of molecules that interact 
      not only with one another, but also with neighboring cells via cell surface 
      receptors. Such interactions, too many to tally, are of paramount importance for 
      the identification of novel disease biomarkers and more personalized therapeutic 
      intervention. Recent advances in big data analytics have allowed the development 
      of online databases where researchers can take advantage of a stochastic 
      evaluation of all the possible interactions and narrow them down to only those of 
      interest for their study, respectively. This novel approach addresses the 
      limitations that currently exist in studies, expands our understanding on ECM 
      interactions, and has the potential to advance the development of targeted 
      therapies. In this article we present the current trends in ECM biology research 
      and highlight its importance in tissue integrity, the main interaction networks, 
      ECM-mediated cell functional properties and issues related to pharmacological 
      targeting.

AB  - Mungbean (Vigna radiata) sprouts are consumed globally as a healthy food with 
      high nutritional values, having antioxidant and anticancer capacity. Under mild 
      salinity stress, plants accumulate more secondary metabolites to alleviate 
      oxidative stress. In this study, metabolomic and transcriptomic changes in 
      mungbean sprouts were identified using a reference cultivar, sunhwa, to 
      understand the regulatory mechanisms of secondary metabolites in response to 
      salinity stress. Under salinity conditions, the contents of 
      phenylpropanoid-derived metabolites, including catechin, chlorogenic acid, 
      isovitexin, p-coumaric acid, syringic acid, ferulic acid, and vitexin, 
      significantly increased. Through RNA sequencing, 728 differentially expressed 
      genes (DEGs) were identified and 20 DEGs were detected in phenylpropanoid and 
      flavonoid biosynthetic pathways. Among them, 11 DEGs encoding key enzymes 
      involved in the biosynthesis of the secondary metabolites that increased after 
      NaCl treatment were significantly upregulated, including dihydroflavonol 
      4-reductase (log(2)FC 1.46), caffeoyl-CoA O-methyltransferase (1.38), chalcone 
      synthase (1.15), and chalcone isomerase (1.19). Transcription factor families, 
      such as MYB, WRKY, and bHLH, were also identified as upregulated DEGs, which play 
      a crucial role in stress responses in plants. Furthermore, this study showed that 
      mild salinity stress can increase the contents of phenylpropanoids and flavonoids 
      in mungbean sprouts through transcriptional regulation of the key enzymes 
      involved in the biosynthetic pathways. Overall, these findings will provide 
      valuable information for molecular breeders and scientists interested in 
      improving the nutritional quality of sprout vegetables.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Increasing evidence has suggested an association between carotid 
      atherosclerosis (CAS) and periodontitis (PD); however, the mechanisms have not 
      been fully understood. This study aims to investigate the shared genes and 
      molecular mechanisms underlying the co-pathogenesis of CAS and PD. METHODS: Gene 
      Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets GSE100927 and GSE10334 were downloaded, and 
      differentially expressed genes (DEGs) shared by both datasets were identified. 
      The functional enrichment analysis of these overlapping DEGs was then conducted. 
      A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was created using the STRING database 
      and Cytoscape software, and PPI key genes were identified using the cytoHubba 
      plugin. Then, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was performed 
      on GSE100927 and GSE10334, and the gene modules most correlated with CAS and PD 
      were identified as key modules. The genes in key modules overlapping with PPI key 
      genes were determined to be the key crosstalk genes. Subsequently, the key 
      crosstalk genes were validated in three independent external datasets (GSE43292 
      [CAS microarray dataset], GSE16134 [PD microarray dataset], and GSE28829 [CAS 
      microarray dataset]). In addition, the immune cell patterns of PD and CAS were 
      evaluated by single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA), and the 
      correlation of key crosstalk genes with each immune cell was calculated. Finally, 
      we investigated the transcription factors (TFs) that regulate key crosstalk genes 
      using NetworkAnalyst 3.0 platform. RESULTS: 355 overlapping DEGs of CAS and PD 
      were identified. Functional enrichment analysis highlighted the vital role of 
      immune and inflammatory pathways in CAS and PD. The PPI network was constructed, 
      and eight PPI key genes were identified by cytoHubba, including CD4, FCGR2A, 
      IL1B, ITGAM, ITGAX, LCK, PTPRC, and TNF. By WGCNA, the turquoise module was 
      identified as the most correlated module with CAS, and the blue module was 
      identified as the most correlated module with PD. Ultimately, ITGAM and LCK were 
      identified as key crosstalk genes as they appeared both in key modules and PPI 
      key genes. Expression levels of ITGAM and LCK were significantly elevated in the 
      case groups of the test datasets (GSE100927 and GSE10334) and validation datasets 
      (GSE43292, GSE16134, and GSE28829). In addition, the expression of multiple 
      immune cells was significantly elevated in PD and CAS compared to controls, and 
      the two key crosstalk genes were both significantly associated with CD4 T cells. 
      Finally, SPI1 was identified as a potential key TF, which regulates the two key 
      crosstalk genes. CONCLUSION: This study identified the key crosstalk genes and TF 
      in PD and CAS, which provides new insights for further studies on the 
      co-morbidity mechanisms of CAS and PD from an immune and inflammatory 
      perspective.

AB  - CCT3 played a key role in many cancers. This study aimed to further explore the 
      characteristics of CCT3 from a pan-cancer perspective and reveal the driving 
      forces for CCT3. By bioinformatic analysis, we found that the mRNA and protein 
      levels of CCT3 were abnormally elevated in most tumor types and were correlated 
      with poor prognosis. Single-cell sequencing data indicated an abnormal increase 
      of CCT3 expression in both malignant cells and multiple immune cells. In the 
      tumor microenvironment, CCT3 expression was negatively relevant with immune cell 
      infiltration and immune checkpoint genes expression. In colon cancer, knockdown 
      of CCT3 inhibited cell proliferation. Gene set enrichment analysis showed that 
      CCT3 may be oncogenic by regulating amino acid metabolism. Furthermore, we 
      predicted sensitive drugs for CCT3 by virtual screening and sensitivity analysis. 
      Many driver genes such as TP53 and KRAS were essential for CCT3 overexpression. 
      Epigenetic factors, enhancers in particular, were also critical for CCT3 
      expression. Additionally, we constructed the lncRNA/circRNA-miRNA-CCT3 regulatory 
      network. Collectively, CCT3 had the potential to be a diagnostic and prognostic 
      biomarker for multiple tumor types. CCT3 expression was relevant with an 
      immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. CCT3 could be a new molecular target 
      for colon cancer. Both genetic and epigenetic factors were responsible for CCT3 
      expression in tumors.

TI  - Extracellular vesicle miRNAs in breast milk of obese mothers.
PG  - 976886
LID - 10.3389/fnut.2022.976886 [doi]
LID - 976886
AB  - BACKGROUND: Breast milk has abundant extracellular vesicles (EVs) containing 
      various biological molecules (cargo), including miRNAs. EVs are not degraded in 
      the gastrointestinal system and circulation; thus, breast milk EVs (bEVs) are 
      expected to interact with other organs in breastfed infants and modify the gene 
      expression of recipient cells using miRNAs. Maternal pre-pregnancy BMI is a 
      critical factor influencing the composition of breast milk. Thus, in mothers with 
      obesity, miRNAs in bEVs can be altered, which might be associated with adverse 
      health outcomes in infants. In this study, we examined 798 miRNAs to determine 
      which miRNAs are altered in the bEVs of mothers with obesity and their potential 
      impact on breastfed infants. METHODS: We recruited healthy nursing mothers who 
      were either of normal weight (BMI < 25) or with obesity (BMI ≥ 30) based on their 
      pre-pregnancy BMI, and delivered a singleton baby in the prior 6 months. EVs were 
      isolated from breast milk with ultracentrifugation. bEV characteristics were 
      examined by flow cytometry and fluorescence imaging of EV markers. A total of 798 
      miRNAs were screened using a NanoString human miRNA panel to find differentially 
      expressed miRNAs in bEVs of mothers with obesity compared to mothers of normal 
      weight. RESULTS: We included 65 nursing mothers: 47 of normal weight and 18 with 
      obesity based on pre-pregnancy BMI. After bEV isolation, we confirmed the 
      expression of various EV markers. Out of 37 EV markers, CD326 (EpCaM) was the 
      most highly expressed in bEVs. The most abundant miRNAs in bEVs include 
      miR-30b-5p, miR-4454, miR-494-3p, and let-7 miRNAs. Target genes of the top 10 
      miRNAs were associated with cancer, prolactin pathway, EGFR, ErbB, and FoxO 
      signaling pathway. In bEVs of mothers with obesity, 19 miRNAs were differentially 
      expressed (adjusted p < 0.05 cut-off), which include miR-575, miR-630, 
      miR-642a-3p, and miR-652-5p. These miRNAs and their target genes were associated 
      with neurological diseases and psychological disorders. CONCLUSION: In this 
      study, we characterized bEVs and demonstrated altered miRNAs in bEVs of mothers 
      with obesity and identified the pathways of their potential target genes. Our 
      findings will provide insight for future studies investigating the role of bEVs 
      in breastfed infants.

AB  - Increasing evidence suggests synaptic dysfunction is a central and possibly 
      triggering factor in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). Despite this, we still 
      know very little about the molecular profile of an ALS synapse. To address this 
      gap, we designed a synaptic proteomics experiment to perform an unbiased 
      assessment of the synaptic proteome in the ALS brain. We isolated 
      synaptoneurosomes from fresh-frozen post-mortem human cortex (11 controls and 18 
      ALS) and stratified the ALS group based on cognitive profile (Edinburgh Cognitive 
      and Behavioural ALS Screen (ECAS score)) and presence of a C9ORF72 hexanucleotide 
      repeat expansion (C9ORF72-RE). This allowed us to assess regional differences and 
      the impact of phenotype and genotype on the synaptic proteome, using Tandem Mass 
      Tagging-based proteomics. We identified over 6000 proteins in our 
      synaptoneurosomes and using robust bioinformatics analysis we validated the 
      strong enrichment of synapses. We found more than 30 ALS-associated proteins in 
      synaptoneurosomes, including TDP-43, FUS, SOD1 and C9ORF72. We identified almost 
      500 proteins with altered expression levels in ALS, with region-specific changes 
      highlighting proteins and pathways with intriguing links to neurophysiology and 
      pathology. Stratifying the ALS cohort by cognitive status revealed almost 150 
      specific alterations in cognitively impaired ALS synaptic preparations. 
      Stratifying by C9ORF72-RE status revealed 330 protein alterations in the 
      C9ORF72-RE +ve group, with KEGG pathway analysis highlighting strong enrichment 
      for postsynaptic dysfunction, related to glutamatergic receptor signalling. We 
      have validated some of these changes by western blot and at a single synapse 
      level using array tomography imaging. In summary, we have generated the first 
      unbiased map of the human ALS synaptic proteome, revealing novel insight into 
      this key compartment in ALS pathophysiology and highlighting the influence of 
      cognitive decline and C9ORF72-RE on synaptic composition.

AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignant tumors. This 
      tumor presents with an insidious onset, rapid progression, and frequent 
      recurrence. Ferroptosis is a newly discovered mode of programmed cell death that 
      may play a key role in the progression of HCC. This study aimed to investigate 
      the prognostic value of ferroptosis-related genes (FRGs) in HCC and their impact 
      on tumor immune function, thereby providing new insights into targeted therapy 
      for HCC. First, 43 differentially expressed FRGs were identified using the TCGA 
      database, and four prognostically relevant methylation-driven FRGs (G6PD, HELLS, 
      RRM2, and STMN1) were screened via survival and methylation analyses. Gene 
      co-expression, mutation, and clinicopathological characterization indicated that 
      these four pivotal FRGs play essential roles in tumor progression. We also 
      validated these four genes using transcriptomic and proteomic data as well as 
      cohort samples from our patients. Moreover, receiver operator characteristic 
      (ROC) curves confirmed that the signatures of the four FRGs were independent 
      prognostic factors in HCC. Gene set enrichment analysis of the four FRGs showed 
      statistically significant associations with pathways related to HCC 
      proliferation. Finally, the TIMER and TISIDB databases indicated that the four 
      FRGs were statistically significantly correlated with tumor-infiltrating immune 
      cells and immune checkpoint expression. Taken together, this study provides 
      information guiding a novel therapeutic strategy targeting FRGs for HCC 
      treatment.

TI  - Berberine Overcomes Gemcitabine-Associated Chemoresistance through Regulation of 
      Rap1/PI3K-Akt Signaling in Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma.
LID - 10.3390/ph15101199 [doi]
LID - 1199
AB  - Gemcitabine (Gem)-based chemotherapy is one of the first-line treatments for 
      pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). However, its clinical effect is limited 
      due to development of chemoresistance. Various naturally occurring compounds, 
      including Berberine (BBR), provide an anti-cancer efficacy with time-tested 
      safety, individually and in combination with chemotherapeutic drugs. Accordingly, 
      we hypothesized that BBR might enhance the chemosensitivity to Gem in PDAC. In 
      this study, cell culture studies using MIA PaCa-2 and BxPC-3 cells, followed by 
      analysis in patient-derived organoids were performed to evaluate the anti-cancer 
      effects of BBR in PDAC. Considering that cancer is a significant manifestation of 
      increased chronic inflammatory stress, systems biology approaches are prudent for 
      the identification of molecular pathways and networks responsible for 
      phytochemical-induced anti-cancer activity, we used these approaches for 
      BBR-mediated chemosensitization to Gem. Firstly, Gem-resistant (Gem-R) PDAC cells 
      were established, and the combination of BBR and Gem revealed superior 
      anti-cancer efficacy in Gem-R cells. Furthermore, the combination treatment 
      induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in Gem-R PDAC cells. Transcriptomic 
      profiling investigated the Rap1 and PI3K-Akt signaling pathway as a key regulator 
      of Gem-resistance and was a key mediator for BBR-mediated chemosensitization in 
      PDAC cells. All cell culture-based findings were successfully validated in 
      patient-derived organoids. In conclusion, we demonstrate that BBR-mediated 
      reversal of chemoresistance to Gem manifests through Rap1/PI3K-Akt signaling in 
      PDAC.

TI  - Expression Profiles of Kidney Mitochondrial Proteome during the Progression of 
      the Unilateral Ureteral Obstruction: Focus on Energy Metabolism Adaptions.
LID - 10.3390/metabo12100936 [doi]
LID - 936
AB  - Kidney diseases encompass many pathologies, including obstructive nephropathy 
      (ON), a common clinical condition caused by different etiologies such as 
      urolithiasis, prostatic hyperplasia in males, tumors, congenital stenosis, and 
      others. Unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) in rodents is an experimental model 
      widely used to explore the pathophysiology of ON, replicating vascular 
      alterations, tubular atrophy, inflammation, and fibrosis development. In 
      addition, due to the kidney's high energetic demand, mitochondrial function has 
      gained great attention, as morphological and functional alterations have been 
      demonstrated in kidney diseases. Here we explore the kidney mitochondrial 
      proteome differences during a time course of 7, 14, and 21 days after the UUO in 
      rats, revealing changes in proteins involved in three main metabolic pathways, 
      oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA), and the 
      fatty acid (FA) metabolism, all of them related to bioenergetics. Our results 
      provide new insight into the mechanisms involved in metabolic adaptations 
      triggered by the alterations in kidney mitochondrial proteome during the ON.

TI  - The Deubiquitinating Enzyme USP48 Interacts with the Retinal 
      Degeneration-Associated Proteins UNC119a and ARL3.
LID - 10.3390/ijms232012527 [doi]
LID - 12527
AB  - Proteins related to the ubiquitin-proteasome system play an important role during 
      the differentiation and ciliogenesis of photoreceptor cells. Mutations in several 
      genes involved in ubiquitination and proteostasis have been identified as 
      causative of inherited retinal dystrophies (IRDs) and ciliopathies. USP48 is a 
      deubiquitinating enzyme whose role in the retina is still unexplored although 
      previous studies indicate its relevance for neurosensory organs. In this work, we 
      describe that a pool of endogenous USP48 localises to the basal body in retinal 
      cells and provide data that supports the function of USP48 in the photoreceptor 
      cilium. We also demonstrate that USP48 interacts with the IRD-associated proteins 
      ARL3 and UNC119a, and stabilise their protein levels using different mechanisms. 
      Our results suggest that USP48 may act in the regulation/stabilisation of key 
      ciliary proteins for photoreceptor function, in the modulation of intracellular 
      protein transport, and in ciliary trafficking to the photoreceptor outer segment.

LID - 10.3390/ijms232012294 [doi]
LID - 12294
AB  - The well-known hepatotoxicity mechanism resulting from alpha-amanitin (α-AMA) 
      exposure arises from RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) inhibition. RNAP Ⅱ inhibition 
      occurs through the dysregulation of mRNA synthesis. However, the signaling 
      pathways in hepatocytes that arise from α-AMA have not yet been fully elucidated. 
      Here, we identified that the RAS/RAF/ERK signaling pathway was activated through 
      quantitative phosphoproteomic and molecular biological analyses in Huh-7 cells. 
      Bioinformatics analysis showed that α-AMA exposure increased protein 
      phosphorylation in a time-dependent α-AMA exposure. In addition, phosphorylation 
      increased not only the components of the ERK signaling pathway but also U2AF65 
      and SPF45, known splicing factors. Therefore, we propose a novel mechanism of 
      α-AMA as follows. The RAS/RAF/ERK signaling pathway involved in aberrant splicing 
      events is activated by α-AMA exposure followed by aberrant splicing events 
      leading to cell death in Huh-7 cells.

TI  - Transcription Factors as Important Regulators of Changes in Behavior through 
      Domestication of Gray Rats: Quantitative Data from RNA Sequencing.
LID - 10.3390/ijms232012269 [doi]
LID - 12269
AB  - Studies on hereditary fixation of the tame-behavior phenotype during animal 
      domestication remain relevant and important because they are of both basic 
      research and applied significance. In model animals, gray rats Rattus norvegicus 
      bred for either an enhancement or reduction in defensive response to humans, for 
      the first time, we used high-throughput RNA sequencing to investigate 
      differential expression of genes in tissue samples from the tegmental region of 
      the midbrain in 2-month-old rats showing either tame or aggressive behavior. A 
      total of 42 differentially expressed genes (DEGs; adjusted p-value  <  0.01 and 
      fold-change  >  2) were identified, with 20 upregulated and 22 downregulated 
      genes in the tissue samples from tame rats compared with aggressive rats. Among 
      them, three genes encoding transcription factors (TFs) were detected: Ascl3 was 
      upregulated, whereas Fos and Fosb were downregulated in tissue samples from the 
      brains of tame rats brain. Other DEGs were annotated as associated with 
      extracellular matrix components, transporter proteins, the neurotransmitter 
      system, signaling molecules, and immune system proteins. We believe that these 
      DEGs encode proteins that constitute a multifactorial system determining the 
      behavior for which the rats have been artificially selected. We demonstrated that 
      several structural subtypes of E-box motifs—known as binding sites for many 
      developmental TFs of the bHLH class, including the ASCL subfamily of TFs—are 
      enriched in the set of promoters of the DEGs downregulated in the tissue samples 
      of tame rats’. Because ASCL3 may act as a repressor on target genes of other 
      developmental TFs of the bHLH class, we hypothesize that the expression of TF 
      gene Ascl3 in tame rats indicates longer neurogenesis (as compared to aggressive 
      rats), which is a sign of neoteny and domestication. Thus, our domestication 
      model shows a new function of TF ASCL3: it may play the most important role in 
      behavioral changes in animals.

TI  - E2F4DN Transgenic Mice: A Tool for the Evaluation of E2F4 as a Therapeutic Target 
      in Neuropathology and Brain Aging.
LID - 10.3390/ijms232012093 [doi]
LID - 12093
AB  - E2F4 was initially described as a transcription factor with a key function in the 
      regulation of cell quiescence. Nevertheless, a number of recent studies have 
      established that E2F4 can also play a relevant role in cell and tissue 
      homeostasis, as well as tissue regeneration. For these non-canonical functions, 
      E2F4 can also act in the cytoplasm, where it is able to interact with many 
      homeostatic and synaptic regulators. Since E2F4 is expressed in the nervous 
      system, it may fulfill a crucial role in brain function and homeostasis, being a 
      promising multifactorial target for neurodegenerative diseases and brain aging. 
      The regulation of E2F4 is complex, as it can be chemically modified through 
      acetylation, from which we present evidence in the brain, as well as methylation, 
      and phosphorylation. The phosphorylation of E2F4 within a conserved threonine 
      motif induces cell cycle re-entry in neurons, while a dominant negative form of 
      E2F4 (E2F4DN), in which the conserved threonines have been substituted by 
      alanines, has been shown to act as a multifactorial therapeutic agent for 
      Alzheimer's disease (AD). We generated transgenic mice neuronally expressing 
      E2F4DN. We have recently shown using this mouse strain that expression of E2F4DN 
      in 5xFAD mice, a known murine model of AD, improved cognitive function, reduced 
      neuronal tetraploidization, and induced a transcriptional program consistent with 
      modulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide proteostasis and brain homeostasis recovery. 
      5xFAD/E2F4DN mice also showed reduced microgliosis and astrogliosis in both the 
      cerebral cortex and hippocampus at 3-6 months of age. Here, we analyzed the 
      immune response in 1 year-old 5xFAD/E2F4DN mice, concluding that reduced 
      microgliosis and astrogliosis is maintained at this late stage. In addition, the 
      expression of E2F4DN also reduced age-associated microgliosis in wild-type mice, 
      thus stressing its role as a brain homeostatic agent. We conclude that E2F4DN 
      transgenic mice represent a promising tool for the evaluation of E2F4 as a 
      therapeutic target in neuropathology and brain aging.

TI  - The Emerging Roles of Protein Interactions with O-GlcNAc Cycling Enzymes in 
      Cancer.
LID - 10.3390/cancers14205135 [doi]
LID - 5135
AB  - The dynamic O-GlcNAc modification of intracellular proteins is an important 
      nutrient sensor for integrating metabolic signals into vast networks of highly 
      coordinated cellular activities. Dysregulation of the sole enzymes responsible 
      for O-GlcNAc cycling, O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) and O-GlcNAcase (OGA), and the 
      associated cellular O-GlcNAc profile is a common feature across nearly every 
      cancer type. Many studies have investigated the effects of aberrant OGT/OGA 
      expression on global O-GlcNAcylation activity in cancer cells. However, recent 
      studies have begun to elucidate the roles of protein-protein interactions (PPIs), 
      potentially through regions outside of the immediate catalytic site of OGT/OGA, 
      that regulate greater protein networks to facilitate substrate-specific 
      modification, protein translocalization, and the assembly of larger biomolecular 
      complexes. Perturbation of OGT/OGA PPI networks makes profound changes in the 
      cell and may directly contribute to cancer malignancies. Herein, we highlight 
      recent studies on the structural features of OGT and OGA, as well as the emerging 
      roles and molecular mechanisms of their aberrant PPIs in rewiring cancer 
      networks. By integrating complementary approaches, the research in this area will 
      aid in the identification of key protein contacts and functional modules derived 
      from OGT/OGA that drive oncogenesis and will illuminate new directions for 
      anti-cancer drug development.

TI  - Changes of Protein Expression after CRISPR/Cas9 Knockout of miRNA-142 in Cell 
      Lines Derived from Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma.
LID - 10.3390/cancers14205031 [doi]
LID - 5031
AB  - BACKGROUND: As microRNA-142 (miR-142) is the only human microRNA gene where 
      mutations have consistently been found in about 20% of all cases of diffuse large 
      B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), we wanted to determine the impact of miR-142 
      inactivation on protein expression of DLBCL cell lines. METHODS: miR-142 was 
      deleted by CRISPR/Cas9 knockout in cell lines from DLBCL. RESULTS: By proteome 
      analyses, miR-142 knockout resulted in a consistent up-regulation of 52 but also 
      down-regulation of 41 proteins in GC-DLBCL lines BJAB and SUDHL4. Various 
      mitochondrial ribosomal proteins were up-regulated in line with their 
      pro-tumorigenic properties, while proteins necessary for MHC-I presentation were 
      down-regulated in accordance with the finding that miR-142 knockout mice have a 
      defective immune response. CFL2, CLIC4, STAU1, and TWF1 are known targets of 
      miR-142, and we could additionally confirm AKT1S1, CCNB1, LIMA1, and TFRC as new 
      targets of miR-142-3p or -5p. CONCLUSIONS: Seed-sequence mutants of miR-142 
      confirmed potential targets and novel targets of miRNAs can be identified in 
      miRNA knockout cell lines. Due to the complex contribution of miRNAs within 
      cellular regulatory networks, in particular when miRNAs highly present in RISC 
      complexes are replaced by other miRNAs, primary effects on gene expression may be 
      covered by secondary layers of regulation.

AB  - PYCARD is a protein engaged in inflammation, pyroptosis, and apoptosis. However, 
      the function of PYCARD in human cancers remains unclear. The objective of our 
      study was to explore PYCARD expression and prognostic value in human cancers. 
      Public databases were used to assess PYCARD expression and prognostic value. The 
      TISIDB database was used to explore the associations between PYCARD expression 
      and different immune subtypes. The correlations between PYCARD expression and ICP 
      genes, MMR genes, MSI, and TMB were also investigated. The immunotherapy response 
      was assessed using the TIDE database. Single-cell RNA databases evaluated the 
      PYCARD expression of immune cells. External datasets and immunohistochemical 
      staining were conducted to validate PYCARD expression and prognostic value. The 
      results showed that PYCARD expression varied in several cancers and was 
      associated with prognosis, immune-related genes, published biomarkers, and 
      immunotherapy response. Of note, PYCARD expression was upregulated in renal 
      cancers with high diagnostic ability. Upregulation of PYCARD was correlated with 
      worse prognosis in KIRC and external validation cohorts. In conclusion, PYCARD 
      demonstrated strong correlations with prognosis, immune response, and disease 
      progression in pan-cancer analysis. In ccRCC, PYCARD might serve as a biomarker 
      for diagnosis and therapeutic target-boosting immunotherapy response.

TI  - Sentinel Lymph Node Gene Expression Signature Predicts Recurrence-Free Survival 
      in Cutaneous Melanoma.
LID - 10.3390/cancers14204973 [doi]
LID - 4973
AB  - We sought to develop a sentinel lymph node gene expression signature score 
      predictive of disease recurrence in patients with cutaneous melanoma. Gene 
      expression profiling was performed on SLN biopsies using U133A 2.0 Affymetrix 
      gene chips. The top 25 genes associated with recurrence-free survival (RFS) were 
      selected and a penalized regression function was used to select 12 genes with a 
      non-zero coefficient. A proportional hazards regression model was used to 
      evaluate the association between clinical covariates, gene signature score, and 
      RFS. Among the 45 patients evaluated, 23 (51%) had a positive SLN. Twenty-one 
      (46.7%) patients developed disease recurrence. For the top 25 differentially 
      expressed genes (DEG), 12 non-zero penalized coefficients were estimated (CLGN, 
      C1QTNF3, ADORA3, ARHGAP8, DCTN1, ASPSCR1, CHRFAM7A, ZNF223, PDE6G, CXCL3, HEXIM1, 
      HLA-DRB). This 12-gene signature score was significantly associated with RFS (p < 
      0.0001) and produced a bootstrap C index of 0.888. In univariate analysis, 
      Breslow thickness, presence of primary tumor ulceration, SLN positivity were each 
      significantly associated with RFS. After simultaneously adjusting for these 
      prognostic factors in relation to the gene signature, the 12-gene score remained 
      a significant independent predictor for RFS (p < 0.0001). This SLN 12-gene 
      signature risk score is associated with melanoma recurrence regardless of SLN 
      status and may be used as a prognostic factor for RFS.

TI  - Developmental Potency and Metabolic Traits of Extended Pluripotency Are 
      Faithfully Transferred to Somatic Cells via Cell Fusion-Induced Reprogramming.
LID - 10.3390/cells11203266 [doi]
LID - 3266
AB  - As a novel cell type from eight-cell-stage embryos, extended pluripotent stem 
      cells (EPSCs) are known for diverse differentiation potency in both 
      extraembryonic and embryonic lineages, suggesting new possibilities as a 
      developmental research model. Although various features of EPSCs have been 
      defined, their ability to directly transfer extended pluripotency to 
      differentiated somatic cells by cell fusion remains to be elucidated. Here, we 
      derived EPSCs from eight-cell mouse embryos and confirmed their extended 
      pluripotency at the molecular level and extraembryonic differentiation ability. 
      Then, they were fused with OG2(+/-) ROSA(+/-) neural stem cells (NSCs) by the 
      polyethylene-glycol (PEG)-mediated method and further analyzed. The resulting 
      fused hybrid cells exhibited pluripotential markers with upregulated 
      EPSC-specific gene expression. Furthermore, the hybrid cells contributed to the 
      extraembryonic and embryonic lineages in vivo and in vitro. RNA sequencing 
      analysis confirmed that the hybrid cells showed distinct global expression 
      patterns resembling EPSCs without parental expression of NSC markers, indicating 
      the complete acquisition of extended pluripotency and the erasure of the somatic 
      memory of NSCs. Furthermore, ultrastructural observation and metabolic analysis 
      confirmed that the hybrid cells rearranged the mitochondrial morphology and 
      bivalent metabolic profile to those of EPSCs. In conclusion, the extended 
      pluripotency of EPSCs could be transferred to somatic cells through 
      fusion-induced reprogramming.

TI  - Chlamydia trachomatis Alters Mitochondrial Protein Composition and Secretes 
      Effector Proteins That Target Mitochondria.
PG  - e0042322
LID - 10.1128/msphere.00423-22 [doi]
LID - e00423-22
AB  - Mitochondria are critical cellular organelles that perform a wide variety of 
      functions, including energy production and immune regulation. To perform these 
      functions, mitochondria contain approximately 1,500 proteins, the majority of 
      which are encoded in the nuclear genome, translated in the cytoplasm, and 
      translocated to the mitochondria using distinct mitochondrial targeting sequences 
      (MTS). Bacterial proteins can also contain MTS and localize to the mitochondria. 
      For the obligate intracellular human pathogen Chlamydia trachomatis, interaction 
      with various host cell organelles promotes intracellular replication. However, 
      the extent and mechanisms through which Chlamydia cells interact directly with 
      mitochondria remain unclear. We investigated the presence of MTS in the C. 
      trachomatis genome and discovered 30 genes encoding proteins with around 70% or 
      greater probability of mitochondrial localization. Five are translocated to the 
      mitochondria upon ectopic expression in HeLa cells. Mass spectrometry of isolated 
      mitochondria from infected cells revealed that two of these proteins localize to 
      the mitochondria during infection. Comparison of mitochondria from infected and 
      uninfected cells suggests that chlamydial infection affects the mitochondrial 
      protein composition. Around 125 host proteins were significantly decreased or 
      absent in mitochondria from infected cells. Among these were proapoptotic factors 
      and those related to mitochondrial fission/fusion dynamics. Conversely, 82 host 
      proteins were increased in or specific to mitochondria of infected cells, many of 
      which act as antiapoptotic factors and upregulators of cellular metabolism. These 
      data support the notion that C. trachomatis specifically targets host 
      mitochondria to manipulate cell fate decisions and metabolic function to support 
      pathogen survival and replication. IMPORTANCE Obligate intracellular bacteria 
      have evolved multiple means to promote their intracellular survival and 
      replication within the otherwise harsh environment of the eukaryotic cell. 
      Nutrient acquisition and avoidance of cellular defense mechanisms are critical to 
      an intracellular lifestyle. Mitochondria are critical organelles that produce 
      energy in the form of ATP and regulate programmed cell death responses to 
      invasive pathogenic microbes. Cell death prior to completion of replication would 
      be detrimental to the pathogen. C. trachomatis produces at least two and possibly 
      more proteins that target the mitochondria. Collectively, C. trachomatis 
      infection modulates the mitochondrial protein composition, favoring a profile 
      suggestive of downregulation of apoptosis.

AB  - PURPOSE: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has poor prognosis and high mortality 
      among gastrointestinal tumors because of its insidious onset and strong 
      invasiveness. However, there was little understanding of their pathogenesis. The 
      purpose of this study was to use bioinformatics analysis to identify genes 
      associated with the immune microenvironment in HBV-related HCC and to develop new 
      therapeutic targets to prevent and treat cancer. METHODS: RNA-seq data of 
      HBV-related HCC cases were downloaded from TCGA-LIHC database. ESTIMATE and 
      Deseq2 algorithms were used to screen out differentially expressed genes (DEGs). 
      WGCNA was used to construct gene coexpression networks. In key modules, 
      functional enrichment analysis was performed. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) 
      was used to screen hub genes, and survival analysis was conducted to assess their 
      prognostic significance. Following, we search for key genes differentially 
      expressed between cancerous and paracancerous tissues in GSE136247 and GSE121248 
      datasets. Reveal the potential links between key genes in immune infiltration by 
      using TIMER. Finally, in TCGA-LIHC database, integration of key genes with 
      clinical data were used to further validate their correlation with prognosis. 
      RESULTS: In the cohort of HBV-related HCC patients, immune/stromal/ESTIMATE 
      scores were not significantly associated with patient prognosis. After 
      bioinformatics analysis, screening out five key genes was significantly related 
      to the prognosis of HBV-related HCC. Downregulation of SLAMF1 and TRAF3IP3 
      suggested poor prognosis and was related to a variety of immune cell 
      infiltration. Furthermore, compared with adjacent nontumor tissues, TRAF3IP3 and 
      SLAMF1 were highly expressed in tumor tissues and were linked to tumor 
      recurrences. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, SLAMF1 and TRAF3IP3 were identified with 
      higher expression in tumor tissues and associated with tumor recurrence. It will 
      be a new research direction of tumor progress and treatment.

AB  - Inducible co-stimulator (ICOS), an immune costimulatory molecule, has been found 
      to play an essential role across various malignancies. This study investigated 
      the transcriptome profile and clinical characterization of ICOS in gliomas. 
      Clinical information and transcriptome data of 301 glioma samples were downloaded 
      from the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA) dataset for analysis (CGGA301 
      cohort). Furthermore, the results were validated in 697 samples with RNAseq data 
      from the TCGA glioma dataset and 325 gliomas with RNAseq data from the CGGA325 
      dataset. Immunohistochemistry was performed to evaluate ICOS protein expression 
      across different WHO grades in a tissue microarray (TMA). In addition, 
      single-cell sequencing data from CGGA and GSE 163108 datasets were used to 
      analyze the ICOS expression across different cell types. Statistical analyses and 
      figure production were performed with R-language. We found that ICOS was 
      significantly upregulated in higher-grade, IDH wild type, and mesenchymal subtype 
      of gliomas. Functional enrichment analyses revealed that ICOS was mainly involved 
      in glioma-related immune response. Moreover, ICOS showed a robust correlation 
      with other immune checkpoints, including the PD1/PD-L1/PD-L2 pathway, CTLA4, 
      ICOSL (ICOS ligand), and IDO1. Subsequent Tumor Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion 
      (TIDE) analysis revealed that GBM patients with higher ICOS expression seemed to 
      be more sensitive to ICB therapy. Furthermore, based on seven clusters of 
      metagenes, GSVA identified that ICOS was tightly associated with HCK, LCK, MHC-I, 
      MHC-II, STAT1, and interferon, especially with LCK, suggesting a strong 
      correlation between ICOS and T-cell activity in gliomas. In cell lineage 
      analysis, Higher-ICOS gliomas tended to recruit dendritic cells, monocytes, and 
      macrophages into the tumor microenvironment. Single-cell sequencing analysis 
      indicated that ICOS was highly expressed by regulatory T cells (Tregs), 
      especially in mature Tregs. Finally, patients with higher ICOS had shortened 
      survival. ICOS was an independent prognosticator for glioma patients. In 
      conclusion, higher ICOS is correlated with more malignancy of gliomas and is 
      significantly associated with Treg activity among glioma-related immune 
      responses. Moreover, ICOS could contribute as an independent prognostic factor 
      for gliomas. Our study highlights the role of ICOS in glioma and may facilitate 
      therapeutic strategies targeting ICOS for glioma.

AB  - Molecular targeted therapy has shown potential in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) 
      patients, and immunotherapy applications are developing rapidly. However, 
      clinical guidance for making individualized therapy decisions for HCC patients 
      remains lacking. MDH (Medication Decision in HCC) gene signatures comprising 70 
      genes were screened using transcriptomic data from multikinase inhibitor 
      (TKI)-resistant HCC cells and HCC patient-derived xenograft model (PDX) models. 
      Four MDH subtypes with distinct biological and clinical characteristics were 
      defined by unsupervised cluster analysis of HCC data from The Cancer Genome Atlas 
      (TCGA) database. To facilitate individualized and reasonable clinical guidance 
      for each HCC patient, we constructed the MDH score. Comprehensive analysis 
      suggested high MDH scores were associated with TKI resistance, a high proportion 
      of stromal cell infiltration and poor survival outcomes. We recommend concomitant 
      stromal activity intervention and immunotherapy for this type of HCC. Moreover, 
      low MDH scores indicate TKI sensitivity, and a combination of targeted and 
      immunotherapy is recommended. The nomogram constructed by iteration least 
      absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression analysis 
      successfully predicted 3- or 5-year survival outcomes and mortality risks of HCC 
      patients. In conclusion, TKI resistance model-based MDH gene signatures provide 
      novel insight into potential mechanisms of drug resistance and heterogeneity in 
      HCC. Integrative analysis plus a simplified decision model may aid personalized 
      treatment and prognostic assessment among HCC patients.

AB  - Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) has developed specialized mechanisms to 
      parasitize its host cell, the macrophage. These mechanisms allow it to overcome 
      killing by oxidative burst and persist in the wake of an inflammatory response. 
      Mtb infection in the majority of those exposed is controlled in an asymptomatic 
      form referred to as latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI). HIV is a well-known 
      catalyst of reactivation of LTBI to active TB infection (ATB). Through the use of 
      nonhuman primates (NHPs) co-infected with Mtb and Simian Immunodeficiency Virus 
      (Mtb/SIV), we are able to simulate human progression of TB/AIDS comorbidity. The 
      advantage of NHP models is that they recapitulate the breadth of human TB 
      outcomes, including immune control of infection, and loss of this control due to 
      SIV co-infection. Identifying correlates of immune control of infection is 
      important for both vaccine and therapeutics development. Using macaques infected 
      with Mtb or Mtb/SIV and with different clinical outcomes we attempted to identify 
      signatures between those that progress to active infection after SIV challenge 
      (reactivators) and those that control the infection (non-reactivators). We 
      particularly focused on pathways relevant to myeloid origin cells such as 
      macrophages, as these innate immunocytes have an important contribution to the 
      initial control or the lack thereof, following Mtb infection. Using bacterial 
      burden, C-reactive protein (CRP), and other clinical indicators of disease 
      severity as a guide, we were able to establish gene signatures of host disease 
      state and progression. In addition to gene signatures, clustering algorithms were 
      used to differentiate between host disease states and identify relationships 
      between genes. This allowed us to identify clusters of genes which exhibited 
      differential expression profiles between the three groups of macaques: ATB, LTBI 
      and Mtb/SIV. The gene signatures were associated with pathways relevant to 
      apoptosis, ATP production, phagocytosis, cell migration, and Type I interferon 
      (IFN), which are related to macrophage function. Our results suggest novel 
      macrophage functions that may play roles in the control of Mtb infection with and 
      without co-infection with SIV. These results particularly point towards an 
      interplay between Type I IFN signaling and IFN-γ signaling, and the resulting 
      impact on lung macrophages as an important determinant of progression to TB.

AB  - Inaccurate cleavage of pri- and pre-miRNA hairpins by Drosha and Dicer results in 
      the generation of miRNA isoforms known as isomiRs. isomiRs with 5'-end variations 
      (5'-isomiRs) create a new dimension in miRNA research since they have different 
      seed regions and distinct targetomes. We developed isomiRTar 
      (https://isomirtar.hse.ru)-a comprehensive portal that allows one to analyze 
      expression profiles and targeting activity of 5'-isomiRs in cancer. Using the 
      Cancer Genome Atlas sequencing data, we compiled the list of 1022 5'-isomiRs 
      expressed in 9282 tumor samples across 31 cancer types. Sequences of these 
      isomiRs were used to predict target genes with miRDB and TargetScan. The putative 
      interactions were then subjected to the co-expression analysis in each cancer 
      type to identify isomiR-target pairs supported by significant negative 
      correlations. Downstream analysis of the data deposited in isomiRTar revealed 
      both cancer-specific and cancer-conserved 5'-isomiR expression landscapes. Pairs 
      of isomiRs differing in one nucleotide shift from 5'-end had poorly overlapping 
      targetomes with the median Jaccard index of 0.06. The analysis of colorectal 
      cancer 5'-isomiR-mediated regulatory networks revealed promising candidate tumor 
      suppressor isomiRs: hsa-miR-203a-3p-+1, hsa-miR-192-5p-+1 and hsa-miR-148a-3p-0. 
      In summary, we believe that isomiRTar will help researchers find novel mechanisms 
      of isomiR-mediated gene silencing in different types of cancer.

AB  - Multi-drug resistant tuberculosis still remains a major public health crisis 
      globally. With the emergence of newer active tuberculosis disease, the 
      requirement of prolonged treatment time and adherence to therapy till its 
      completion necessitates the search of newer therapeutics, targeting human host 
      factors. The current work utilized statistical meta-analysis of human gene 
      transcriptomes of active pulmonary tuberculosis disease obtained from six public 
      datasets. The meta-analysis resulted in the identification of 2038 significantly 
      differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the active tuberculosis disease. The 
      gene ontology (GO) analysis revealed that these genes were major contributors in 
      immune responses. The pathway enrichment analyses identified from various human 
      canonical pathways are related to other infectious diseases. In addition, the 
      comparison of the DEGs with the tuberculosis genome wide association study (GWAS) 
      datasets revealed the presence of few genetic variants in their proximity. The 
      analysis of protein interaction networks (human and Mycobacterium tuberculosis) 
      and host directed drug-target interaction network led to new candidate drug 
      targets for drug repurposing studies. The current work sheds light on host genes 
      and pathways enriched in active tuberculosis disease and suggest potential drug 
      repurposing targets for host-directed therapies.

AB  - Organophosphate (OP) pesticides are widely used in agriculture. While acute 
      cholinergic toxicity has been extensively studied, chronic effects on other 
      neurons are less understood. Here, we demonstrated that the OP pesticide 
      chlorpyrifos (CPF) and its oxon metabolite are dopaminergic neurotoxicants in 
      Caenorhabditis elegans. CPF treatment led to inhibition of mitochondrial complex 
      II, II + III, and V in rat liver mitochondria, while CPF-oxon did not (complex II 
      + III and IV inhibition observed only at high doses). While the effect on C. 
      elegans cholinergic behavior was mostly reversible with toxicant washout, 
      dopamine-associated deficits persisted, suggesting dopaminergic neurotoxicity was 
      irreversible. CPF reduced the mitochondrial content in a dose-dependent manner 
      and the fat modulatory genes cyp-35A2 and cyp-35A3 were found to have a key role 
      in CPF neurotoxicity. These findings were consistent with in vitro effects of CPF 
      and CPF-oxon on nuclear receptor signaling and fatty acid/steroid metabolism 
      observed in ToxCast assays. Two-way hierarchical analysis revealed in vitro 
      effects on estrogen receptor, pregnane X receptor, and peroxisome 
      proliferator-activated receptor gamma pathways as well as neurotoxicity of CPF, 
      malathion, and diazinon, whereas these effects were not detected in malaoxon and 
      diazoxon. Taken together, our study suggests that mitochondrial toxicity and 
      metabolic effects of CPF, but not CPF-oxon, have a key role of CPF neurotoxicity 
      in the low-dose, chronic exposure. Further mechanistic studies are needed to 
      examine mitochondria as a common target for all OP pesticide parent compounds, 
      because this has important implications on cumulative pesticide risk assessment.

TI  - SPP1 facilitates cell migration and invasion by targeting COL11A1 in lung 
      adenocarcinoma.
PG  - 324
LID - 10.1186/s12935-022-02749-x [doi]

AB  - BACKGROUND: Secreted phosphoprotein 1 (SPP1), an extracellular secreted glycol 
      phosphoprotein, is closely related to tumor biologies, such as proliferation, 
      migration, and invasion. However, the role and biological function of SPP1 in 
      lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) was still ambiguous. METHODS: SPP1 expression in LUAD 
      tissues and its associations with clinical features and prognosis was 
      investigated using meta-analysis, immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining methods, 
      and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Moreover, the 
      potential mechanism related to SPP1 was identified by using the Gene Set 
      Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) method. A series of function assays were conducted to 
      determine the biological role of SPP1 in LUAD cell migration and invasion in 
      vitro and vivo. The co-expressed genes of SPP1 were obtained and verified by 
      western blot assays. The influence of SPP1 on Collagen type XI alpha 1 (COL11A1) 
      expression and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers was analyzed using 
      western blot assays. RESULTS: The expression of SPP1 in LUAD tissues and cells 
      was significantly higher than that in normal tissues and cells. And positively 
      associations of SPP1 expression with TNM stage, lymph node metastasis, and 
      invasion depth were observed. Patients with high SPP1 expression had unfavorable 
      survival. The multivariable Cox regression analysis revealed that SPP1 expression 
      was an independent prognostic factor of LUAD patients. Furthermore, 
      downregulation of SPP1 could inhibit cell migration and invasion both in vitro 
      and vivo, reduce the expression of epithelial marker (E-cadherin), and increase 
      the expression of mesenchymal markers (N-cadherin and vimentin). Using 
      bioinformatics and western blot assays, we confirmed that COL11A1 acted as the 
      downstream of SPP1, and SPP1 knockdown could significantly downregulate the 
      COL11A1 expression. Importantly, suppression of cell migration and invasion and 
      the expression changes of EMT markers induced by SPP1 downregulation could be 
      reversed by COL11A1 overexpression. CONCLUSIONS: SPP1 facilitates cell migration 
      and invasion by upregulating COL11A1 expression and that acts as a potential 
      biomarker of metastasis and prognosis for LUAD.

AB  - The last 20 years have witnessed an explosion in publicly available gene 
      expression and proteomic data and new tools to help researchers analyze these 
      data. Tools typically include statistical approaches to identify differential 
      expression, integrate prior knowledge, visualize results, and suggest how 
      differential expression relates to changes in phenotype. Here, we provide a 
      simple web-based tool that bridges some of the gaps between the functionality 
      available to those studying eukaryotes and those studying prokaryotes. 
      Specifically, our Shiny web application ESKAPE Act PLUS allows researchers to 
      upload results of high-throughput bacterial gene or protein expression 
      experiments from 13 species, including the six ESKAPE pathogens, to our system 
      and receive (i) an analysis of which KEGG pathways or GO terms are significantly 
      activated or repressed, (ii) visual representations of the magnitude of 
      activation or repression in each category, and (iii) detailed diagrams showing 
      known relationships between genes in each regulated KEGG pathway and fold changes 
      of individual genes. Importantly, our statistical approach does not require users 
      to identify which genes or proteins are differentially expressed. ESKAPE Act PLUS 
      provides high-quality statistics and graphical representations not available 
      using other web-based systems to assess whether prokaryotic biological functions 
      are activated or repressed by experimental conditions. To our knowledge, ESKAPE 
      Act PLUS is the first application that provides pathway activation analysis and 
      pathway-level visualization of gene or protein expression for prokaryotes. 
      IMPORTANCE ESKAPE pathogens are bacteria of concern because they develop 
      antibiotic resistance and can cause life-threatening infections, particularly in 
      more susceptible immunocompromised people. ESKAPE Act PLUS is a user-friendly web 
      application that will advance research on ESKAPE and other pathogens commonly 
      studied by the biomedical community by allowing scientists to infer biological 
      phenotypes from the results from high-throughput bacterial gene or protein 
      expression experiments. ESKAPE Act PLUS currently supports analysis of 23 strains 
      of bacteria from 13 species and can also be used to re-analyze publicly available 
      data to generate new findings and hypotheses for follow-up experiments.

AB  - Microglia are derived from primitive myeloid cells and gain their early identity 
      in the embryonic brains. However, the mechanism by which the brain milieu confers 
      microglial maturation signature remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate that the 
      bax(cq55) zebrafish and Bax(tm1Sjk) mouse embryos exhibit similarly defective 
      early microglial maturation. BAX, a typical pro-apoptotic factor, is highly 
      enriched in neuronal cells and regulates microglial maturation through both 
      pro-apoptotic and non-apoptotic mechanisms. BAX regulates dlb via the CaMKII-CREB 
      axis calcium-dependently in living neurons while ensuring the efficient Notch 
      activation in the immigrated pre-microglia by apoptotic neurons. Notch signaling 
      is conserved in supporting embryonic microglia maturation. Compromised microglial 
      development occurred in the Cx3cr1(Cre/+)Rbpj(fl/fl) embryonic mice; however, 
      microglia acquire their appropriate signature when incubated with DLL3 in vitro. 
      Thus, our findings elucidate a BAX-CaMKII-CREB-Notch network triggered by the 
      neuronal milieu in microglial development, which may provide innovative insights 
      for targeting microglia in neuronal disorder treatment.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Cardiac immunology studies in murine models have identified a 
      sizeable population of myocardial B-cells and have shown that its modulation 
      represents a promising strategy to develop novel therapies for heart failure. 
      However, scarce data on B-cells in the human heart leaves unclear whether 
      findings in rodents are relevant to human biology. METHODS: We performed 
      immunohistochemical stains to characterize the amount and distribution of B-cells 
      in human hearts, analyzing both fresh and post-mortem tissue. To gain insight 
      into the biology of human myocardial B-cells we analyzed publicly-available 
      spatial transcriptomics and single-cell sequencing datasets of myocardial and 
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). We validated these findings on 
      primary B-cells sorted from the heart and peripheral blood of left ventricular 
      assistive device recipients. To identify biological pathways upregulated in 
      myocardial B-cells across species, we compared differential gene expression in 
      myocardial vs peripheral blood B-cells across the studied human datasets and 
      published rodent datasets. RESULTS: In healthy human heart samples, we found 
      B-cells at a ratio of 1:8 compared to T-cells (2.41 ± 0.45 vs 19.36 ± 4.43, 
      p-value <0.001). Myocardial B-cells were more abundant in the interstitium 
      compared with the intravascular space (p-value=0.011), and also more abundant in 
      the myocardium vs. epicardium (p-value=0.048). Single-cell gene expression 
      analysis showed that the human myocardium harbored mostly naive B-cells with a 
      gene expression profile distinct from that of PBMC B-cells. Cross-comparison of 
      differentially-expressed genes in myocardial vs. PBMC B-cells across human and 
      rodent datasets identified 703 genes with consistent differential gene expression 
      across species (binomial p-value=2.9e-48). KEGG pathway analysis highlighted 
      "B-cell receptor signaling pathway," "Antigen processing and presentation," and 
      "Cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction" among the top pathways upregulated in 
      cardiac B-cells (FDR <0.001) conserved between species. CONCLUSIONS: Like the 
      murine heart, the human heart harbors naive B-cells that are both intravascular 
      and extravascular. Human myocardial B-cells are fewer and more evenly distributed 
      between these two compartments than rodent myocardial B-cells. However, analysis 
      of single-gene expression data indicates that the biological function of 
      myocardial B-cells is conserved across species.

AB  - Methamphetamine (METH) addiction and withdrawal cause serious harm to both the 
      immune system and nervous system. However, the pathogenesis remains largely 
      unknown. Herein, we investigated the peripheral cytokines and exosomal 
      transcriptome regulatory networks in the patients with METH use disorders (MUDs) 
      undergoing withdrawal. Twenty-seven cytokines were simultaneously assessed in 51 
      subjects, including 22 at the acute withdrawal (AW) stage and 29 at the 
      protracted withdrawal (PW) stage, and 31 age and gender-matched healthy controls 
      (HCs). Compared to the HCs, significantly decreased levels of interleukin 
      (IL)-1β, IL-9, IL-15, Basic FGF, and MIP1a, increased levels of IL-1rα, IL-6, 
      Eotaxin IP-10, VEGF, and RANTES were identified in AW. These disturbances were 
      mostly or partly restored to the baseline in PW. However, the cytokines IL-6, 
      IL-7, and IL-12p70 were consistently increased even after one year of withdrawal. 
      Besides, a significant decrease in CD3(+)T and CD4(+)T cell numbers was observed 
      in AW, and the diminishment was restored to baseline in PW. Comparatively, there 
      were no statistically significant changes in CD8(+)T, NK, and B cells. 
      Furthermore, the exosomal mRNAs and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) were profiled, 
      and the lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA networks were constructed and associated with METH AW 
      and PW stages. Notably, the chemokine signaling was remarkably upregulated during 
      AW. By contrast, the differentially expressed mRNAs/lincRNAs were significantly 
      enriched in neurodegeneration-related diseases. Taken together, a group of METH 
      withdrawal-related cytokines and exosomal mRNA/lncRNA regulatory networks were 
      obtained, which provides a useful experimental and theoretical basis for further 
      understanding of the pathogenesis of the withdrawal symptoms in MUDs.

      Wnt Signaling during Epileptogenesis in a Mouse Model of Temporal Lobe Epilepsy.

AB  - Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (mTLE) is a life-threatening condition 
      characterized by recurrent hippocampal seizures. mTLE can develop after exposure 
      to risk factors such as febrile seizure, trauma, and infection. Within the latent 
      period between exposure and onset of epilepsy, pathological remodeling events 
      occur that contribute to epileptogenesis. The molecular mechanisms responsible 
      are currently unclear. We used the mouse intrahippocampal kainite model of mTLE 
      to investigate transcriptional dysregulation in the ipsilateral and contralateral 
      dentate gyrus (DG), representing the epileptogenic zone (EZ) and peri-ictal zone 
      (PIZ). DG were analyzed after 3, 7, and 14 days by RNA sequencing. In both the EZ 
      and PIZ, transcriptional dysregulation was dynamic over the epileptogenic period 
      with early expression of genes representing cell signaling, migration, and 
      proliferation. Canonical Wnt signaling was upregulated in the EZ and PIZ at 3 
      days. Expression of inflammatory genes differed between the EZ and PIZ, with 
      early expression after 3 days in the PIZ and delayed expression after 7-14 days 
      in the EZ. This suggests that critical gene changes occur early in the 
      hippocampal seizure network and that Wnt signaling may play a role within the 
      latent epileptogenic period. These findings may help to identify novel 
      therapeutic targets that could prevent epileptogenesis.

TI  - HOTAIR/miR-203/CAV1 Crosstalk Influences Proliferation, Migration, and Invasion 
      in the Breast Cancer Cell.

AB  - In recent years, malignant breast cancer metastasis has caused a great increase 
      in mortality. Research on the genetic and molecular mechanisms of malignant 
      breast cancer has continued to deepen, and targeted therapy has become the 
      general trend. Among them, competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA)-related molecules 
      have received much attention. Homeobox transcript antisense RNA (HOTAIR) has been 
      reported to function extensively as a ceRNA in breast cancer. Notably, miR-203 
      and Caveolin 1 (CAV1) have also been found to play a role in breast cancer. 
      However, the relationship between the three remains unclear. In this study, we 
      present a new mechanic through bioinformatics tool and basic experiments: the 
      HOTAIR/miR-203/CAV1 axis, which complemented the role network of HOTAIR as a 
      ceRNA, thus, it will provide a novel potential idea for breast cancer research 
      and therapy.

TI  - Prolonged Exposure to High Temperature Inhibits Shoot Primary and Root Secondary 
      Growth in Panax ginseng.
LID - 10.3390/ijms231911647 [doi]
LID - 11647
AB  - High temperature is one of the most significant abiotic stresses reducing crop 
      yield and quality by inhibiting plant growth and development. Global warming has 
      recently increased the frequency of heat waves, which negatively impacts 
      agricultural fields. Despite numerous studies on heat stress responses and signal 
      transduction in model plant species, the molecular mechanism underlying 
      thermomorphogenesis in Panax ginseng remains largely unknown. Here, we 
      investigated the high temperature response of ginseng at the phenotypic and 
      molecular levels. Both the primary shoot growth and secondary root growth of 
      ginseng plants were significantly reduced at high temperature. Histological 
      analysis revealed that these decreases in shoot and root growth were caused by 
      decreases in cell elongation and cambium stem cell activity, respectively. 
      Analysis of P. ginseng RNA-seq data revealed that heat-stress-repressed stem and 
      root growth is closely related to changes in photosynthesis, cell wall 
      organization, cell wall loosening, and abscisic acid (ABA) and jasmonic acid (JA) 
      signaling. Reduction in both the light and dark reactions of photosynthesis 
      resulted in defects in starch granule development in the storage parenchymal 
      cells of the main tap root. Thus, by combining bioinformatics and histological 
      analyses, we show that high temperature signaling pathways are integrated with 
      crucial biological processes that repress stem and root growth in ginseng, 
      providing novel insight into the heat stress response mechanism of P. ginseng.

TI  - ROCK Inhibitor (Y-27632) Abolishes the Negative Impacts of miR-155 in the 
      Endometrium-Derived Extracellular Vesicles and Supports Embryo Attachment.
LID - 10.3390/cells11193178 [doi]
LID - 3178
AB  - Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are nanosized vesicles that act as snapshots of 
      cellular components and mediate cellular communications, but they may contain 
      cargo contents with undesired effects. We developed a model to improve the 
      effects of endometrium-derived EVs (Endo-EVs) on the porcine embryo attachment in 
      feeder-free culture conditions. Endo-EVs cargo contents were analyzed using 
      conventional and real-time PCR for micro-RNAs, messenger RNAs, and proteomics. 
      Porcine embryos were generated by parthenogenetic electric activation in 
      feeder-free culture conditions supplemented with or without Endo-EVs. The 
      cellular uptake of Endo-EVs was confirmed using the lipophilic dye PKH26. 
      Endo-EVs cargo contained miR-100, miR-132, and miR-155, together with the mRNAs 
      of porcine endogenous retrovirus (PERV) and β-catenin. Targeting PERV with 
      CRISPR/Cas9 resulted in reduced expression of PERV mRNA transcripts and increased 
      miR-155 in the Endo-EVs, and supplementing these in embryos reduced embryo 
      attachment. Supplementing the medium containing Endo-EVs with miR-155 inhibitor 
      significantly improved the embryo attachment with a few outgrowths, while 
      supplementing with Rho-kinase inhibitor (RI, Y-27632) dramatically improved both 
      embryo attachment and outgrowths. Moreover, the expression of miR-100, miR-132, 
      and the mRNA transcripts of BCL2, zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox 1, 
      β-catenin, interferon-γ, protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 1, PERV, 
      and cyclin-dependent kinase 2 were all increased in embryos supplemented with 
      Endo-EVs + RI compared to those in the control group. Endo-EVs + RI reduced 
      apoptosis and increased the expression of OCT4 and CDX2 and the cell number of 
      embryonic outgrowths. We examined the individual and combined effects of RI 
      compared to those of the miR-155 mimic and found that RI can alleviate the 
      negative effects of the miR-155 mimic on embryo attachment and outgrowths. EVs 
      can improve embryo attachment and the unwanted effects of the de trop cargo 
      contents (miR-155) can be alleviated through anti-apoptotic molecules such as the 
      ROCK inhibitor.

      decidualization is a critical contributor to the phenotypic alterations related 
      to pregnancy complications. To understand the molecular factors underlying RSA, 
      we explored the role of longnoncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in the decidual 
      microenvironment where the crosstalk at the fetal-maternal interface occurs. By 
      exploring RNA-seq data from RSA patients, we identified H19, a noncoding RNA that 
      exhibits maternal monoallelic expression, as one of the most upregulated lncRNAs 
      associated with RSA. The paternally expressed fetal mitogen IGF2, which is 
      reciprocally coregulated with H19 within the same imprinting cluster, was also 
      upregulated. Notably, both genes underwent loss of imprinting, as H19 and IGF2 
      were actively transcribed from both parental alleles in some decidual tissues. 
      This loss of imprinting in decidual tissues was associated with the loss of the 
      H3K27m3 repressive histone marker in the IGF2 promoter, CpG hypomethylation at 
      the central CTCF binding site in the imprinting control center (ICR), and the 
      loss of CTCF-mediated intrachromosomal looping. These data suggest that 
      dysregulation of the H19/IGF2 imprinting pathway may be an important epigenetic 
      factor in the decidual microenvironment related to poor decidualization.

AB  - The serine/arginine-rich splicing factors (SRSF)-mediated alternative splicing 
      plays an essential role in the occurrence and progression of hepatocellular 
      carcinoma (HCC). However, the SRSF-based signature that can predict the prognosis 
      and therapy efficiency is yet to be investigated in HCC. Here, we comprehensively 
      assessed the landscape and prognostic significance of the SRSF family genes in 
      HCC. Then, we screened the SRSF family-related genes for signature construction 
      and explored their biological characteristics. We further established an SRSF 
      score consisting of 18 SRSF-associated genes and evaluated its correlation with 
      prognosis and drug sensitivity in HCC. The predictive power of the SRSF score was 
      validated in independent HCC cohorts and different HCC subgroups. Moreover, we 
      further investigated that knockdown of SRSF11, a pivotal gene in the SRSF score, 
      inhibited CDK1-dependent proliferation and enhanced the drug sensitivity of HCC 
      cells. Overall, our study identified a novel SRSF family-based predictive model, 
      and we demonstrated that SRSF11 is a promising therapeutic target for HCC, which 
      enhances our understanding of the SRSF family genes and provides valuable 
      insights into the clinical treatment and molecular mechanisms of HCC.

TI  - Regulating the p53 Tumor Suppressor Network at PML Biomolecular Condensates.
LID - 10.3390/cancers14194549 [doi]
LID - 4549
AB  - By forming specific functional entities, nuclear biomolecular condensates play an 
      important function in guiding biological processes. PML biomolecular condensates, 
      also known as PML nuclear bodies (NBs), are macro-molecular sub-nuclear 
      organelles involved in central biological processes, including anti-viral 
      response and cell fate control upon genotoxic stress. PML condensate formation is 
      stimulated upon cellular stress, and relies on protein-protein interactions 
      establishing a PML protein meshwork capable of recruiting the tumor suppressor 
      p53, along with numerous modifiers of p53, thus balancing p53 posttranslational 
      modifications and activity. This stress-regulated process appears to be 
      controlled by liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), which may facilitate 
      regulated protein-unmixing of p53 and its regulators into PML nuclear 
      condensates. In this review, we summarize and discuss the molecular mechanisms 
      underlying PML nuclear condensate formation, and how these impact the biological 
      function of p53 in driving the cell death and senescence responses. In addition, 
      by using an in silico approach, we identify 299 proteins which share PML and p53 
      as binding partners, thus representing novel candidate proteins controlling p53 
      function and cell fate decision-making at the level of PML nuclear 
      biocondensates.

TI  - Metabolic labeling unveils alterations in the turnover of HDL-associated proteins 
      during diabetes progression in mice.
PG  - E480-E491
LID - 10.1152/ajpendo.00158.2022 [doi]
AB  - Several aspects of diabetes pathophysiology and complications result from 
      hyperglycemia-induced alterations in the structure and function of plasma 
      proteins. Furthermore, insulin has a significant influence on protein metabolism 
      by affecting both the synthesis and degradation of proteins in various tissues. 
      To understand the role of progressive hyperglycemia on plasma proteins, in this 
      study, we measured the turnover rates of high-density lipoprotein 
      (HDL)-associated proteins in control (chow diet), prediabetic [a high-fat diet 
      (HFD) for 8 wk] or diabetic [HFD for 8 wk with low-dose streptozotocin (HFD + 
      STZ) in weeks 5-8 of HFD] C57BL/6J mice using heavy water ((2)H(2)O)-based 
      metabolic labeling approach. Compared with control mice, HFD and HFD + STZ mice 
      showed elevations of fasting plasma glucose levels in the prediabetic and 
      diabetic range, respectively. Furthermore, the HFD and HFD + STZ mice showed 
      increased hepatic triglyceride (TG) levels, total plasma cholesterol, and plasma 
      TGs. The kinetics of 40 proteins were quantified using the proteome dynamics 
      method, which revealed an increase in the fractional synthesis rate (FSR) of 
      HDL-associated proteins in the prediabetic mice compared with control mice, and a 
      decrease in FSR in the diabetic mice. The pathway analysis revealed that proteins 
      with altered turnover rates were involved in acute-phase response, lipid 
      metabolism, and coagulation. In conclusion, prediabetes and diabetes have 
      distinct effects on the turnover rates of HDL proteins. These findings suggest 
      that an early dysregulation of the HDL proteome dynamics can provide mechanistic 
      insights into the changes in protein levels in these conditions.NEW & NOTEWORTHY 
      This study is the first to examine the role of gradual hyperglycemia during 
      diabetes disease progression on HDL-associated protein dynamics in the 
      prediabetes and diabetic mice. Our results show that the fractional synthesis 
      rate of HDL-associated proteins increased in the prediabetic mice whereas it 
      decreased in the diabetic mice compared with control mice. These kinetic changes 
      can help to elucidate the mechanism of altered protein levels and HDL dysfunction 
      during diabetes disease progression.

TI  - Sequence divergence and retrotransposon insertion underlie interspecific 
      epigenetic differences in primates.
LID - 10.1093/molbev/msac208 [doi]
LID - msac208
AB  - Changes in the epigenome can affect the phenotype without the presence of changes 
      in the genomic sequence. Given the high identity of the human and chimpanzee 
      genome sequences, a substantial portion of their phenotypic divergence likely 
      arises from epigenomic differences between the two species. In this study, the 
      transcriptome and epigenome were determined for induced pluripotent stem cells 
      (iPSCs) generated from human and chimpanzee individuals. The transcriptome and 
      epigenomes for trimethylated histone H3 at lysine-4 (H3K4me3) and lysine-27 
      (H3K27me3) showed high levels of similarity between the two species. However, 
      there were some differences in histone modifications. Although such regions, in 
      general, did not show significant enrichment of interspecies nucleotide 
      variations, gains in binding motifs for pluripotency-related transcription 
      factors, especially POU5F1 and SOX2, were frequently found in species-specific 
      H3K4me3 regions. We also revealed that species-specific insertions of 
      retrotransposons, including the LTR5_Hs subfamily in human and a newly identified 
      LTR5_Pt subfamily in chimpanzee, created species-specific H3K4me3 regions 
      associated with increased expression of nearby genes. Human iPSCs have more 
      species-specific H3K27me3 regions, resulting in more abundant bivalent domains. 
      Only a limited number of these species-specific H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 regions 
      overlap with species-biased enhancers in cranial neural crest cells, suggesting 
      that differences in the epigenetic state of developmental enhancers appear late 
      in development. Therefore, iPSCs serve as a suitable starting material for 
      studying evolutionary changes in epigenome dynamics during development.

AB  - The estrous cycle is regulated by rhythmic endocrine interactions of the nervous 
      and reproductive systems, which coordinate the hormonal and ovulatory functions 
      of the ovary. Folliculogenesis and follicle progression require the orchestrated 
      response of a variety of cell types to allow the maturation of the follicle and 
      its sequela, ovulation, corpus luteum formation, and ovulatory wound repair. 
      Little is known about the cell state dynamics of the ovary during the estrous 
      cycle and the paracrine factors that help coordinate this process. Herein, we 
      used single-cell RNA sequencing to evaluate the transcriptome of >34,000 cells of 
      the adult mouse ovary and describe the transcriptional changes that occur across 
      the normal estrous cycle and other reproductive states to build a comprehensive 
      dynamic atlas of murine ovarian cell types and states.

AB  - Methamphetamine (METH) abuse can result in severe neurotoxicity, for which the 
      mechanism is not yet clear. In the present study, we investigated the role of 
      noncoding RNAs in METH-induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity, and analyzed the 
      underlying mechanism using bioinformatic methods. We confirmed by flow cytometry 
      that miR-129-1-3p is involved in promoting dopaminergic apoptosis under METH 
      treatment and its role could be inhibited by a high concentration of 
      circ_0015891. Also, we combined transcriptomic data with bioinformatics to 
      explore the downstream mechanism of miR-129-1-3p regulation of METH-induced 
      apoptosis, highlighted the potentially pivotal figure of response to nutrition. 
      Further bioinformatic analysis of circ_0015891 was conducted as well and showed 
      that circ_0015891 was the sponge of various microRNAs that effect apoptosis by 
      different mechanisms. Collectively, we found a novel circ_0015891/miR-129-1-3p 
      axis that may be a promising therapeutic target for METH-induced dopaminergic 
      neurotoxicity.

AB  - PURPOSE: Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the sixth leading 
      cancer globally, and radiotherapy plays a crucial part in its treatment. This 
      study was designed to identify potential genes related to radiation resistance in 
      HNSCC. METHOD: We first used text mining to obtain common genes related to 
      radiotherapy resistance and HNSCC in published articles. Functional enrichment 
      analyses were conducted to identify the significantly enriched pathways and 
      genes. Protein and protein interactions were performed, and the most significant 
      gene modules were determined; then, genes in the gene modules were validated at 
      transcriptional levels and overall survival. Gene set variation analysis (GSVA) 
      score was calculated, and the association between GSVA score and survival/pathway 
      was estimated. Immune cell infiltration, methylation, and genetic alteration 
      analysis of these genes was conducted in HNSCC patients. Finally, potential 
      sensitive anticancer drugs related to target genes were obtained. RESULT: We 
      identified 583 common genes through text mining. After further validation, a 
      four-gene signature (EPHB2, SPP1, SERPINE1, and VEGFC) was constructed. The 
      patients with higher GSVA scores have a worse prognosis than those with lower 
      GSVA scores. Differences in methylation of these four genes in HNSCC tumor tissue 
      and normal tissue were compared, with higher methylation levels of EBPH2 and SPP1 
      in normal tissue and higher methylation levels of SERPINE1 in the tumor. Immune 
      cell infiltration revealed that the increased expression of these genes was 
      closely related to the infiltration level of CD4+ T cell, neutrophil, macrophage, 
      and dendritic cell. Thirty drugs, including 22 positively and eight negatively 
      correlated drugs that most correlated with related genes, were available for 
      treating HNSCC. CONCLUSION: In this study, we identified four potential genes as 
      well as corresponding drugs that might be related to radioresistance in HNSCC 
      patients. These candidate genes may provide a promising avenue to further elevate 
      radiotherapy efficacy.

      intramuscular adipogenesis in cattle.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Intramuscular preadipocyte differentiation plays a critical role in 
      bovine intramuscular fat (IMF) deposition. However, the roles of different RNAs, 
      including mRNAs, circRNAs, lncRNAs and miRNAs, in regulating the adipogenic 
      differentiation of intramuscular preadipocytes remain largely unclear. RESULTS: 
      In the present study, a whole transcriptome sequencing and analysis, including 
      the analysis of mRNAs, circRNAs, lncRNAs and miRNAs, during different 
      differentiation stages (0, 3, 6, and 9 d) of intramuscular preadipocytes from 
      Qinchuan cattle was performed. All samples were prepared with 3 biological 
      replicates. Here, a total of 27,153 mRNAs, 14,070 circRNAs, 7035 lncRNAs, and 427 
      miRNAs were annotated. Among them, we identified 4848 differentially expressed 
      mRNAs (DEMs), 181 DE circRNAs (DECs), 501 DE lncRNAs (DELs) and 77 DE miRNAs 
      (DEmiRs) between 0 d and other differentiation days (3, 6, and 9 d). GO and KEGG 
      functional enrichment analyses showed that these differentially expressed genes 
      were mainly enriched in cell differentiation, fat metabolism and 
      adipogenesis-related pathways. Furthermore, weighted gene coexpression network 
      analysis (WGCNA) and co-expression network analysis screened out multiple 
      important mRNAs, circRNAs and lncRNAs related to intramuscular adipogenesis. 
      Based on the competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) regulatory mechanism, we finally 
      identified 24 potential ceRNA networks and 31 potential key genes, including 
      FOXO1/miR-330/circRNA2018/MSTRG.20301, GPAM/miR-27b/ciRNA489 and 
      SESN3/miR-433/circRNA2627MSTRG.20342. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides new 
      insights into the differential expression patterns of different transcript types 
      (i.e., mRNAs, circRNAs, lncRNAs and miRNAs) in intramuscular preadipocyte 
      differentiation. Our findings provide data support for studying the molecular 
      mechanism of key mRNAs and noncoding RNAs in IMF deposition, and provide new 
      candidate markers for the molecular breeding of beef cattle.

TI  - Adaptation and evolution of the sea anemone Alvinactis sp. to deep-sea 
      hydrothermal vents: A comparison using transcriptomes.

AB  - Sea anemones are diverse and ecologically successful members of Anthozoa. They 
      are often found in intertidal and shallow waters, although a few of them inhabit 
      harsher living conditions, such as deep-sea hydrothermal vents. Here, we 
      sequenced the transcriptome of the vent sea anemone Alvinactis sp., which was 
      collected from Edmond vent along the central Indian Ocean ridge at a depth of 
      3275 m, to explore the molecular mechanisms related to adaptation to vents. 
      Compared with another deep-sea anemone (Paraphelliactis xishaensis) and five 
      shallow water sea anemones, a total of 117 positively selected genes and 46 
      significantly expanded gene families were found in Alvinactis sp. specifically 
      that may be related to its vent-specific aspect of adaptation. In addition, 127 
      positively selected genes and 23 significantly expanded gene families that were 
      found in both Alvinactis sp. and P. xishaensis. Among these, vent-specific 
      adaptations of Alvinactis sp. may involve genetic alterations in peroxisome, 
      ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation, oxidative phosphorylation, and 
      endocytosis, and its deep-sea adaptation may involve changes in genetic 
      information processing. Differentially expressed genes between Alvinactis sp. and 
      the deep-sea anemone P. xishaensis were enriched in a variety of pathways related 
      to adaptation, such as energy metabolism, genetic information processing, 
      endocytosis, and peroxisomes. Overall, we provided the first transcriptome of sea 
      anemones that inhabit vents, which enriches our knowledge of deep-sea 
      hydrothermal vent adaptation and the diversity of sea anemones.

TI  - Identification of a biomarker and immune infiltration in perivascular adipose 
      tissue of abdominal aortic aneurysm.
PG  - 977910
LID - 10.3389/fphys.2022.977910 [doi]
LID - 977910
AB  - Objective: Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) refers to unusual permanent dilation 
      of the abdominal aorta, and gradual AAA expansion can lead to fatal rupture. 
      However, we lack clear understanding of the pathogenesis of this disease. The 
      effect of perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) on vascular functional status has 
      attracted increasing attention. Here, we try to identify the potential mechanisms 
      linking AAA and PVAT. Methods: We downloaded dataset GSE119717, including 30 
      dilated AAA PVAT samples and 30 non-dilated aorta PVAT samples from AAA cases, 
      from Gene Expression Omnibus to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs). 
      We performed pathway enrichment analysis by Metascape, ClueGo and DAVID to 
      annotate PVAT functional status according to the DEGs. A protein-protein 
      interaction network, the support vector machine (SVM)-recursive feature 
      elimination and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression 
      model were constructed to identify feature genes. Immune infiltration analysis 
      was explored by CIBERSORT. And the correlation between feature gene and immune 
      cells was also calculated. Finally, we used the angiotensin II (Ang II)-ApoE-/- 
      mouse model of AAA to verify the effect of feature gene expression by confirming 
      protein expression using immunohistochemistry and western blot. Results: We 
      identified 22 DEGs, including 21 upregulated genes and 1 downregulated gene. The 
      DEGs were mainly enriched in neutrophil chemotaxis and IL-17 signaling pathway. 
      FOS was identified as a good diagnostic feature gene (AUC = 0.964). Immune 
      infiltration analysis showed a higher level of T cells follicular helper, 
      activated NK cells, Monocytes, activated Mast cells in AAA group. And FOS was 
      correlated with immune cells. Immunohistochemistry and western blot confirmed 
      higher FOS expression in PVAT of the AAA mouse model compared to control group. 
      Conclusion: The differentially expressed genes and pathways identified in this 
      study provide further understanding of how PVAT affects AAA development. FOS was 
      identified as the diagnostic gene. There was an obvious difference in immune 
      cells infiltration between normal and AAA groups.

TI  - Phosphoproteomics reveals that cinobufotalin promotes intrahepatic 
      cholangiocarcinoma cell apoptosis by activating the ATM/CHK2/p53 signaling 
      pathway.
PG  - 982961

LID - 982961
AB  - Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is a malignant tumor that originates from 
      bile duct's epithelial cells and is usually characterized by insidious symptoms 
      and poor prognosis. Cinobufotalin (CB), an active ingredient obtained from the 
      Traditional Chinese Medicine ChanSu, is purported to exhibit a wide range of 
      antitumorigenic activities. However, the mechanism by which it achieves such 
      pharmacological effects remains elusive. Here, we disclosed the mechanism of 
      action by which CB inhibits ICC cells. Initial experiments revealed that the 
      proliferation of RBE and HCCC-9810 cells was significantly inhibited by CB with 
      IC50 values of 0.342 μM and 0.421 μM respectively. CB induced the expression of 
      caspase-3 subsequently leading to the apoptosis of ICC cells. Phosphoproteomics 
      revealed that the phosphorylation of many proteins associated with DNA damage 
      response increased. Kinase-substrate enrichment analysis revealed that ATM was 
      activated after CB treatment, while CDK1 was inactivated. Activated ATM increased 
      p-CHK2-T68 and p-p53-S15, which promoted the expression of FAS, DR4 and DR5 and 
      triggered cell apoptosis. In summary, this work reveals the role of CB in 
      inducing DNA damage and cell apoptosis involved in the activation of the 
      ATM/CHK2/p53 signaling pathway, and indicates that CB may serve as a 
      chemotherapeutic drug candidate for ICC treatment.

TI  - p73 is required for vessel integrity controlling endothelial junctional dynamics

PG  - 535

AB  - Preservation of blood vessel integrity, which is critical for normal physiology 
      and organ function, is controlled at multiple levels, including endothelial 
      junctions. However, the mechanism that controls the adequate assembly of 
      endothelial cell junctions is not fully defined. Here, we uncover TAp73 
      transcription factor as a vascular architect that orchestrates transcriptional 
      programs involved in cell junction establishment and developmental blood vessel 
      morphogenesis and identify Angiomotin (AMOT) as a TAp73 direct transcriptional 
      target. Knockdown of p73 in endothelial cells not only results in decreased 
      Angiomotin expression and localization at intercellular junctions, but also 
      affects its downstream function regarding Yes-associated protein (YAP) 
      cytoplasmic sequestration upon cell-cell contact. Analysis of adherens junctional 
      morphology after p73-knockdown in human endothelial cells revealed striking 
      alterations, particularly a sharp increase in serrated junctions and actin 
      bundles appearing as stress fibers, both features associated with enhanced 
      barrier permeability. In turn, stabilization of Angiomotin levels rescued those 
      junctional defects, confirming that TAp73 controls endothelial junction dynamics, 
      at least in part, through the regulation of Angiomotin. The observed defects in 
      monolayer integrity were linked to hyperpermeability and reduced transendothelial 
      electric resistance. Moreover, p73-knockout retinas showed a defective sprout 
      morphology coupled with hemorrhages, highlighting the physiological relevance of 
      p73 regulation in the maintenance of vessel integrity in vivo. We propose a new 
      model in which TAp73 acts as a vascular architect integrating transcriptional 
      programs that will impinge with Angiomotin/YAP signaling to maintain junctional 
      dynamics and integrity, while balancing endothelial cell rearrangements in 
      angiogenic vessels.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bladder cancer (BLCA) is one of the most common genitourinary 
      malignancies in the world, but its pathogenic genes have not been fully 
      identified and the treatment outcomes are still unsatisfactory. Although the 
      members of 2', 5'-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) gene family are known involved 
      in some tumorous biological processes, the roles of the OAS gene family in BLCA 
      are still undetermined. METHODS: By combining vast bioinformatic datasets 
      analyses of BLCA and the experimental verification on clinical BLCA specimen, we 
      identified the expressions and biological functions of OAS gene family members in 
      BLCA with comparison to normal bladder tissues. RESULTS: The expression levels of 
      OAS gene family members were higher in BLCA than in normal bladder tissues. The 
      expression levels of most OAS genes had correlations with genomic mutation and 
      methylation, and with the infiltration levels of CD4 + T cells, CD8 + T cells, 
      neutrophils, and dendritic cells in the microenvironment of BLCA. In addition, 
      high expressions of OAS1, OAS2, OAS3, and OASL predicted better overall survival 
      in BLCA patients. CONCLUSIONS: The highly expressed OAS genes in BLCA can reflect 
      immune cells infiltration in the tumor microenvironment and predict the better 
      overall survival of BLCA, and thus may be considered as a signature of BLCA. The 
      study provides new insights into the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of BLCA.

AB  - Current methods for the diagnosis and monitoring of bladder cancer are invasive 
      and have suboptimal sensitivity. Liquid biopsy as a non-invasive approach has 
      been capturing attentions recently. To explore the ability of urine-based liquid 
      biopsy in detecting and monitoring genitourinary tumors, we developed a method 
      based on promoter-targeted DNA methylation of urine sediment DNA. We used samples 
      from a primary bladder cancer cohort (n=40) and a healthy cohort (n=40) to train 
      a model and obtained an integrated area under the curve (AUC) > 0.96 in the 
      10-fold cross-validation, which demonstrated the ability of our method for 
      detecting bladder cancer from the healthy. We next validated the model with 
      samples from a recurrent cohort (n=21) and a non-recurrent cohort (n=19) and 
      obtained an AUC > 0.91, which demonstrated the ability of our model in monitoring 
      the progress of bladder cancer. Moreover, 80% (4/5) of samples from patients with 
      benign urothelial diseases had been considered to be healthy sample rather than 
      cancer sample, preliminarily demonstrating the potential of distinguishing benign 
      urothelial diseases from cancer. Further analysis basing on multiple-time point 
      sampling revealed that the cancer signal in 80% (4/5) patients had decreased as 
      expected when they achieved the recurrent-free state. All the results suggested 
      that our method is a promising approach for noninvasive detection and prognostic 
      monitoring of bladder cancer.

AB  - Genome-wide association studies have identified 10q24.32 as a robust 
      schizophrenia risk locus. Here we identify a regulatory variant (rs10786700) that 
      disrupts binding of transcription factors at 10q24.32. We independently confirmed 
      the association between rs10786700 and schizophrenia in a large Chinese cohort (n 
      = 11 547) and uncovered the biological mechanism underlying this association. We 
      found that rs10786700 resides in a super-enhancer element that exhibits dynamic 
      activity change during the development process and that the risk allele (C) of 
      rs10786700 conferred significant lower enhancer activity through enhancing 
      binding affinity to repressor element-1 silencing transcription factor (REST). 
      CRISPR-Cas9-mediated genome editing identified SUFU as a potential target gene by 
      which rs10786700 might exert its risk effect on schizophrenia, as deletion of 
      rs10786700 downregulated SUFU expression. We further investigated the role of 
      Sufu in neurodevelopment and found that Sufu knockdown inhibited proliferation of 
      neural stem cells and neurogenesis, affected molecular pathways (including 
      neurodevelopment-related pathways, PI3K-Akt and ECM-receptor interaction 
      signalling pathways) associated with schizophrenia and altered the density of 
      dendritic spines. These results reveal that the functional risk single nucleotide 
      polymorphism rs10786700 at 10q24.32 interacts with REST synergistically to 
      regulate expression of SUFU, a novel schizophrenia risk gene which is involved in 
      schizophrenia pathogenesis by affecting neurodevelopment and spine morphogenesis.

AB  - Lodging is one of the major abiotic stresses, affecting the total crop yield and 
      quality. The improved lodging resistance and its component traits potentially 
      reduce the yield losses. The section modulus (SM), bending moment at breaking 
      (M), pushing resistance (PR), and coefficient of lodging resistance (cLr) are the 
      key elements to estimate the lodging resistance. Understanding the genetic 
      architecture of lodging resistance-related traits will help to improve the culm 
      strength and overall yield potential. In this study, a natural population of 795 
      globally diverse genotypes was further divided into two (indica and japonica) 
      subpopulations and was used to evaluate the lodging resistance and culm 
      strength-related traits. Significant diversity was observed among the studied 
      traits. We carried out the genome-wide association evaluation of four lodging 
      resistance traits with 3.3 million deep resolution single-nucleotide polymorphic 
      (SNP) markers. The general linear model (GLM) and compressed mixed linear model 
      (MLM) were used for the whole population and two subpopulation genome-wide 
      association studies (GWAS), and a 1000-time permutation test was performed to 
      remove the false positives. A total of 375 nonredundant QTLs were observed for 
      four culm strength traits on 12 chromosomes of the rice genome. Then, 33 
      pleiotropic loci governing more than one trait were mined. A total of 4031 
      annotated genes were detected within the candidate genomic region of 33 
      pleiotropic loci. The functional annotations and metabolic pathway enrichment 
      analysis showed cellular localization and transmembrane transport as the top gene 
      ontological terms. The in silico and in vitro expression analyses were conducted 
      to validate the three candidate genes in a pleiotropic QTL on chromosome 7. It 
      validated OsFBA2 as a candidate gene to contribute to lodging resistance in rice. 
      The haplotype analysis for the candidate gene revealed a significant functional 
      variation in the promoter region. Validation and introgression of alleles that 
      are beneficial to induce culm strength may be used in rice breeding for lodging 
      resistance.

TI  - Gene Networks and Pathways Involved in Escherichia coli Response to Multiple 
      Stressors.
LID - 10.3390/microorganisms10091793 [doi]
LID - 1793
AB  - Stress response helps microorganisms survive extreme environmental conditions and 
      host immunity, making them more virulent or drug resistant. Although both 
      reductionist approaches investigating specific genes and systems approaches 
      analyzing individual stress conditions are being used, less is known about gene 
      networks involved in multiple stress responses. Here, using a systems biology 
      approach, we mined hundreds of transcriptomic data sets for key genes and 
      pathways involved in the tolerance of the model microorganism Escherichia coli to 
      multiple stressors. Specifically, we investigated the E. coli K-12 MG1655 
      transcriptome under five stresses: heat, cold, oxidative stress, nitrosative 
      stress, and antibiotic treatment. Overlaps of transcriptional changes between 
      studies of each stress factor and between different stressors were determined: 
      energy-requiring metabolic pathways, transport, and motility are typically 
      downregulated to conserve energy, while genes related to survival, bona fide 
      stress response, biofilm formation, and DNA repair are mainly upregulated. The 
      transcription of 15 genes with uncharacterized functions is higher in response to 
      multiple stressors, which suggests they may play pivotal roles in stress 
      response. In conclusion, using rank normalization of transcriptomic data, we 
      identified a set of E. coli stress response genes and pathways, which could be 
      potential targets to overcome antibiotic tolerance or multidrug resistance.

TI  - Diet-Induced Gut Barrier Dysfunction Is Exacerbated in Mice Lacking Cannabinoid 1 
      Receptors in the Intestinal Epithelium.
LID - 10.3390/ijms231810549 [doi]
LID - 10549
AB  - The gut barrier provides protection from pathogens and its function is 
      compromised in diet-induced obesity (DIO). The endocannabinoid system in the gut 
      is dysregulated in DIO and participates in gut barrier function; however, whether 
      its activity is protective or detrimental for gut barrier integrity is unclear. 
      We used mice conditionally deficient in cannabinoid receptor subtype-1 (CB(1)R) 
      in the intestinal epithelium (intCB1-/-) to test the hypothesis that CB(1)Rs in 
      intestinal epithelial cells provide protection from diet-induced gut barrier 
      dysfunction. Control and intCB1-/- mice were placed for eight weeks on a 
      high-fat/sucrose Western-style diet (WD) or a low-fat/no-sucrose diet. 
      Endocannabinoid levels and activity of their metabolic enzymes were measured in 
      the large-intestinal epithelium (LI). Paracellular permeability was tested in 
      vivo, and expression of genes for gut barrier components and inflammatory markers 
      were analyzed. Mice fed WD had (i) reduced levels of endocannabinoids in the LI 
      due to lower activity of their biosynthetic enzymes, and (ii) increased 
      permeability that was exacerbated in intCB1-/- mice. Moreover, intCB1-/- mice fed 
      WD had decreased expression of genes for tight junction proteins and increased 
      expression of inflammatory markers in LI. These results suggest that CB(1)Rs in 
      the intestinal epithelium serve a protective role in gut barrier function in DIO.

TI  - ZNF281 Promotes Colon Fibroblast Activation in TGFβ1-Induced Gut Fibrosis.
LID - 10.3390/ijms231810261 [doi]
LID - 10261
AB  - Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are chronic inflammatory 
      disorders of the gastrointestinal tract. Chronic inflammation is the main factor 
      leading to intestinal fibrosis, resulting in recurrent stenosis, especially in CD 
      patients. Currently, the underlying molecular mechanisms of fibrosis are still 
      unclear. ZNF281 is a zinc-finger transcriptional regulator that has been 
      characterized as an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-inducing 
      transcription factor, suggesting its involvement in the regulation of 
      pluripotency, stemness, and cancer. The aim of this study is to investigate in 
      vivo and in vitro the role of ZNF281 in intestinal fibrogenesis. Intestinal 
      fibrosis was studied in vivo in C57BL/6J mice with chronic colitis induced by two 
      or three cycles of administration of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS). The 
      contribution of ZNF281 to gut fibrosis was studied in vitro in the human colon 
      fibroblast cell line CCD-18Co, activated by the pro-fibrotic cytokine TGFβ1. 
      ZNF281 was downregulated by siRNA transfection, and RNA-sequencing was performed 
      to identify genes regulated by TGFβ1 in activated colon fibroblasts via ZNF281. 
      Results showed a marked increase of ZNF281 in in vivo murine fibrotic colon as 
      well as in in vitro human colon fibroblasts activated by TGFβ1. Moreover, 
      abrogation of ZNF281 in TGFβ1-treated fibroblasts affected the expression of 
      genes belonging to specific pathways linked to fibroblast activation and 
      differentiation into myofibroblasts. We demonstrated that ZNF281 is a key 
      regulator of colon fibroblast activation and myofibroblast differentiation upon 
      fibrotic stimuli by transcriptionally controlling extracellular matrix (ECM) 
      composition, remodeling, and cell contraction, highlighting a new role in the 
      onset and progression of gut fibrosis.

TI  - Detecting the Critical States of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Based on Degree Matrix 
      Network Entropy by Cross-Tissue Analysis.
LID - 10.3390/e24091249 [doi]
LID - 1249
AB  - Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a metabolic disease caused by multiple 
      etiologies, the development of which can be divided into three states: normal 
      state, critical state/pre-disease state, and disease state. To avoid irreversible 
      development, it is important to detect the early warning signals before the onset 
      of T2DM. However, detecting critical states of complex diseases based on 
      high-throughput and strongly noisy data remains a challenging task. In this 
      study, we developed a new method, i.e., degree matrix network entropy (DMNE), to 
      detect the critical states of T2DM based on a sample-specific network (SSN). By 
      applying the method to the datasets of three different tissues for experiments 
      involving T2DM in rats, the critical states were detected, and the dynamic 
      network biomarkers (DNBs) were successfully identified. Specifically, for liver 
      and muscle, the critical transitions occur at 4 and 16 weeks. For adipose, the 
      critical transition is at 8 weeks. In addition, we found some "dark genes" that 
      did not exhibit differential expression but displayed sensitivity in terms of 
      their DMNE score, which is closely related to the progression of T2DM. The 
      information uncovered in our study not only provides further evidence regarding 
      the molecular mechanisms of T2DM but may also assist in the development of 
      strategies to prevent this disease.

TI  - Genomic Evolution of ST11 Carbapenem-Resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae from 2011 to 
      2020 Based on Data from the Pathosystems Resource Integration Center.
LID - 10.3390/genes13091624 [doi]
LID - 1624
AB  - (1) Objective: ST11 carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) is 
      widespread throughout the world, and the mechanisms for the transmission and 
      evolution of major serotypes, ST11-KL47 and ST11-KL64, were analyzed to 
      investigate the global distribution and evolutionary characteristics of ST11 
      CRKP; (2) Methods: The Pathosystems Resource Integration Center (PATRIC) database 
      was downloaded and all K. pneumoniae from 2011 to 2020 were screened to obtain 
      ST11 CRKP genome assemblies with basic information. The relationship of serotype 
      evolution between KL47 and KL64 was then investigated using statistical and 
      bioinformatic analysis; (3) Results: In total, 386 ST11 CRKP isolates were 
      included for analysis. Blood (31.09%, 120/386), respiratory tract (23.06%, 
      89/386), and feces (20.21%, 78/386) were the major sources of samples. China was 
      the leading country where ST11 CRKP was isolated. KL47 and KL64 were found to be 
      the most prevalent serotypes. ST11-KL64 CRKP [median 78(P25~P75: 72~79.25)] had 
      remarkably more virulence genes than the KL47 [median 63(P25~P75: 63~69)], and 
      the distinction was statistically significant (p < 0.001). A differential 
      comparison of virulence genes between KL47 and KL64 revealed 35 differential 
      virulence genes, including rmpA/rmpA2, iucABCD, iutA, etc. The comparison of the 
      recombination of serotype-determining regions between the two serotypes revealed 
      that KL64 CRKP carried more nucleotide sequences in the CD1-VR2-CD2 region than 
      KL47 CRKP. More nucleotide sequences added approximately 303 base pairs (bp) with 
      higher GC content (58.14%), which might facilitate the evolution of the serotype 
      toward KL64; (4) Conclusions: KL47 and KL64 have become the predominant serotypes 
      of ST11 CRKP. KL64 CRKP carries more virulence genes than KL47 and has increased 
      by approximately 303 bp through recombinant mutations, thus facilitating the 
      evolution of KL47 to KL64. Stricter infection prevention and control measures 
      should be developed to deal with the epidemic transmission of ST11-KL64 CRKP.

TI  - Genome-Wide Population Structure and Selection Signatures of Yunling Goat Based 
      on RAD-seq.
LID - 10.3390/ani12182401 [doi]
LID - 2401
AB  - Animal diseases impose a huge burden on the countries where diseases are endemic. 
      Conventional control strategies of vaccines and veterinary drugs are to control 
      diseases from a pharmaceutical perspective. Another alternative approach is using 
      pre-existing genetic disease resistance or tolerance. We know that the Yunling 
      goat is an excellent local breed from Yunnan, southwestern China, which has 
      characteristics of strong disease resistance and remarkable adaptability. 
      However, genetic information about the selection signatures of Yunling goats is 
      limited. We reasoned that the genes underlying the observed difference in disease 
      resistance might be identified by investigating selection signatures between two 
      different goat breeds. Herein, we selected the Nubian goat as the reference group 
      to perform the population structure and selection signature analysis by using 
      RAD-seq technology. The results showed that two goat breeds were divided into two 
      clusters, but there also existed gene flow. We used Fst (F-statistics) and π 
      (pi/θπ) methods to carry out selection signature analysis. Eight selected regions 
      and 91 candidate genes were identified, in which some genes such as DOK2, 
      TIMM17A, MAVS, and DOCK8 related to disease and immunity and some genes such as 
      SPEFI, CDC25B, and MIR103 were associated with reproduction. Four GO (Gene 
      Ontology) terms (GO:0010591, GO:001601, GO:0038023, and GO:0017166) were 
      associated with cell migration, signal transduction, and immune responses. The 
      KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) signaling pathways were mainly 
      associated with immune responses, inflammatory responses, and stress reactions. 
      This study preliminarily revealed the genetic basis of strong disease resistance 
      and adaptability of Yunling goats. It provides a theoretical basis for the 
      subsequent genetic breeding of disease resistance of goats.

TI  - Oviductal Extracellular Vesicles Enhance Porcine In Vitro Embryo Development by 
      Modulating the Embryonic Transcriptome.
LID - 10.3390/biom12091300 [doi]
LID - 1300
AB  - Oviductal extracellular vesicles (oEVs) have been identified as important 
      components of the oviductal fluid (OF) and have been pointed to as key modulators 
      of gamete/embryo-maternal interactions. Here, we determined the functional impact 
      of oEVs on embryo development and the embryonic transcriptome in porcine. 
      Experiment 1 examined the effect of oEVs and OF on embryo development. In 
      vitro-produced embryos were cultured with oEVs or OF for 2 or 7 days using an in 
      vitro sequential system or without supplementation (control). Experiment 2 
      analyzed transcriptomic alterations of EV-treated embryos versus control and the 
      oEVs RNA cargo by RNA-sequencing. Two days of EV treatment enhanced embryo 
      development over time when compared to other treatments. Different RNA expression 
      profiles between embryos treated with EVs for two or seven days and untreated 
      controls were obtained, with 54 and 59 differentially expressed (DE) genes and 
      six and seven DE miRNAs, respectively. In oEV RNA cargo, 12,998 RNAs and 163 
      miRNAs were identified. Integrative analyses pointed to specific oEV components 
      that might act as modulators of the embryonic transcriptome, such as S100A11, 
      ANXA2 or miR-21-5p. Overall, the findings suggested that oEVs could be a 
      potential strategy to improve porcine IVP outcomes, particularly by using two 
      days of EV treatment.

AB  - High seedling vigor can improve the ability to compete against weeds and flooding 
      at the seedling stage and is essential for the direct seeding of rice. Early 
      shoot length is an important performance index in seedling vigor evaluation. 
      However, information on the identity of rice germplasm with high seedling vigor, 
      and the genetic basis of seedling vigor are not well understood. In this study, 
      we have conducted a genome-wide association study using 302 international diverse 
      rice accessions from the Rice Diversity Panel 2. Six quantitative trait loci 
      (QTLs) were found to associate with shoot length (SL). The locus qSL2 was further 
      analyzed for candidate gene characterization. We identified OsCPS1, which encodes 
      CDP synthase and functions in GA (Gibberellins) biosynthesis in rice, exhibits 
      differential expression between long and short SL accessions. Using the 
      Nipponbare genome sequence as the reference, we identified a 36 bp deletion in 
      the 5' UTR of OsCPS1 in long SL accessions, which is absent in short SL 
      accessions. GA content analysis showed that the levels of bioactive GA(1) and 
      GA(4) are considerably higher in long SL accessions than in short SL accessions. 
      Genome-wide gene expression analysis indicated the expression of some 
      photosynthesis genes is higher in long SL accessions than in short SL accessions. 
      In contrast, genes involved in ABA (Abscisic Acid)-activated signal pathway 
      showed lower expression in long SL accessions. Population analysis across wild 
      rice, indica and japonica, suggested that OsCPS1 may be under selection in 
      japonica during domestication. The results suggest that OsCPS1 is a candidate 
      gene underlying qSL2. These data provide a promising source for candidate genetic 
      variation associated with seedling vigor, with practical applications in rice 
      breeding.

AB  - Cis-natural antisense transcripts (cis-NATs) are transcribed from the same 
      genomic locus as their partner gene but from the opposite DNA strand and overlap 
      with the partner gene transcript. Here, we developed a simple and convenient 
      program termed CCIVR (comprehensive cis-NATs identifier via RNA-seq data) that 
      comprehensively identifies all kinds of cis-NATs based on genome annotation with 
      expression data obtained from RNA-seq. Using CCIVR with genome databases, we 
      demonstrated total cis-NAT pairs from 11 model organisms. CCIVR analysis with 
      RNA-seq data from parthenogenetic and androgenetic embryonic stem cells 
      identified well-known imprinted cis-NAT pair, KCNQ1/KCNQ1OT1, ensuring the 
      availability of CCIVR. Finally, CCIVR identified cis-NAT pairs that demonstrate 
      inversely correlated expression upon TGFβ stimulation including cis-NATs that 
      functionally repress their partner genes by introducing epigenetic alteration in 
      the promoters of partner genes. Thus, CCIVR facilitates the investigation of 
      structural characteristics and functions of cis-NATs in numerous processes in 
      various species.

AB  - Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths globally, and lung 
      adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is the most common type of lung cancer. Gene dysregulation 
      plays an essential role in the development of LUAD. Drug repositioning based on 
      associations between drug target genes and LUAD target genes are useful to 
      discover potential new drugs for the treatment of LUAD, while also reducing the 
      monetary and time costs of new drug discovery and development. Here, we developed 
      a pipeline based on machine learning to predict potential LUAD-related target 
      genes through established graph attention networks (GATs). We then predicted 
      potential drugs for the treatment of LUAD through gene coincidence-based and gene 
      network distance-based methods. Using data from 535 LUAD tissue samples and 59 
      precancerous tissue samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas, 48,597 genes were 
      identified and used for the prediction model building of the GAT. The GAT model 
      achieved good predictive performance, with an area under the receiver operating 
      characteristic curve of 0.90. 1,597 potential LUAD-related genes were identified 
      from the GAT model. These LUAD-related genes were then used for drug 
      repositioning. The gene overlap and network distance with the target genes were 
      calculated for 3,070 drugs and 672 preclinical compounds approved by the US Food 
      and Drug Administration. At which, bromoethylamine was predicted as a novel 
      potential preclinical compound for the treatment of LUAD, and cimetidine and 
      benzbromarone were predicted as potential therapeutic drugs for LUAD. The 
      pipeline established in this study presents new approach for developing targeted 
      therapies for LUAD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The effect of GuizhiFuling Wan (GFW) on adenomyosis (AM) is definite. 
      This study aimed to explore the mechanism and key therapeutic targets of GFW in 
      treating AM through network pharmacology combined with molecular docking and 
      experimental verification. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In network pharmacology, 
      firstly, the active components of GFW, its drug, and disease targets were 
      screened through several related public databases, and GFW-AM common targets were 
      obtained after the intersection. Then, the biological function (Gene Ontology, 
      GO) and pathway (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, KEGG) of GFW in 
      treating AM were enriched and analyzed. Finally, the interaction and binding 
      force between key components and key targets of GFW were verified by molecular 
      docking. In the animal part, the effect of GFW on the expression of matrix 
      metallopeptidase 2 (MMP-2), matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP-9), and vascular 
      endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in mice with AM was observed by HE staining, 
      ELISA, and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: In this study, 89 active components of 
      GFW, 102 related targets, and 291 targets of AM were collected. After the 
      intersection, 26 common targets were finally obtained. The key active compounds 
      were baicalein, sitosterol, and β-sitosterol, and the key targets were MMP-2, 
      MMP-9, and VEGF. GO and KEGG enrichment analyses showed that biological processes 
      such as the positive regulation of vascular endothelial migration and signaling 
      pathways such as TNF and HIF-1 were involved in regulating angiogenesis, 
      invasion, and metastasis in AM. The molecular docking results showed that 
      baicalein, β-sitosterol, and stigmasterol had better binding potential with 
      MMP-2, MMP-9, and VEGF. The results of in vivo analysis showed that GFW could 
      decrease the serum content and protein expression of MMP-2, MMP-9, and VEGF in 
      mice with AM. CONCLUSIONS: GFW could reduce the expression of MMP-2, MMP-9, and 
      VEGF, which might be an essential mechanism for GFW to inhibit the invasion and 
      metastasis of ectopic tissues of AM.

AB  - At present, although the early treatment of sepsis is advocated, the treatment 
      effect of sepsis is unsatisfactory, and the mortality rate remains high. Shenfu 
      injection (SFI) has been used to treat sepsis with good clinical efficacy. Based 
      on network pharmacology, this study adopted a new research strategy to identify 
      the potential therapeutic targets and key active ingredients of SFI for sepsis 
      from the perspective of the pathophysiology of sepsis. This analysis identified 
      28 active ingredients of SFI based on UHPLC-QQQ MS, including 18 ginsenosides and 
      10 aconite alkaloids. 59 targets were associated with the glycocalyx and sepsis 
      pathways. Based on the number of targets related to the pathophysiological 
      process of sepsis, we identified songorine, ginsenoside Rf, ginsenoside Re, and 
      karacoline as the key active ingredients of SFI for the treatment of sepsis. 
      According to the cluster analysis of MCODE and the validation on the GEO dataset, 
      LGALS3, BCHE, AKT1, and IL2 were identified as the core targets. This study 
      further explored the therapeutic mechanism and the key active ingredients of SFI 
      in sepsis and provided candidate compounds for drug development.

TI  - Treponema denticola Induces Interleukin-36γ Expression in Human Oral Gingival 
      Keratinocytes via the Parallel Activation of NF-κB and Mitogen-Activated Protein 
      Kinase Pathways.

AB  - The oral epithelial barrier acts as both a physical barrier to the abundant oral 
      microbiome and a sentry for the immune system that, in health, constrains the 
      accumulation of the polymicrobial plaque biofilm. The immune homeostasis during 
      gingivitis that is largely protective becomes dysregulated, unproductive, and 
      destructive to gingival tissue as periodontal disease progresses to 
      periodontitis. The progression to periodontitis is associated with the dysbiosis 
      of the oral microbiome, with increasing prevalences and abundances of periodontal 
      pathogens such as Treponema denticola. Despite the association of T. denticola 
      with a chronic inflammatory disease, relatively little is known about gingival 
      epithelial cell responses to T. denticola infection. Here, we characterized the 
      transcriptome of gingival keratinocytes following T. denticola challenge and 
      identified interleukin-36γ (IL-36γ) as the most differentially expressed 
      cytokine. IL-36γ expression is regulated by p65 NF-κB and the activation of both 
      the Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase 
      (MAPK) pathways downstream of Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2). Finally, we 
      demonstrate for the first time that mitogen- and stress-activated kinase 1 (MSK1) 
      contributes to IL-36γ expression and may link the activation of MAPK and NF-κB 
      signaling. These findings suggest that the interactions of T. denticola with the 
      gingival epithelium lead to elevated IL-36γ expression, which may be a critical 
      inducer and amplifier of gingival inflammation and subsequent alveolar bone loss.

TI  - Pseudo-Chromosomal Genome Assembly in Combination with Comprehensive 
      Transcriptome Analysis in Agaricus bisporus Strain KMCC00540 Reveals Mechanical 
      Stimulus Responsive Genes Associated with Browning Effect.
LID - 10.3390/jof8080886 [doi]
LID - 886
AB  - Agaricus bisporus is one of the world's most popular edible mushrooms, including 
      in South Korea. We performed de novo genome assembly with a South Korean 
      white-colored cultivar of A. bisporus, KMCC00540. After generating a 
      scaffold-level genomic sequence, we inferred chromosome-level assembly by genomic 
      synteny analysis with the representative A. bisporus strains H97 and H39. The 
      KMCC00540 genome had 13 pseudochromosomes comprising 33,030,236 bp mostly 
      covering both strains. A comparative genomic analysis with cultivar H97 indicated 
      that most genomic regions and annotated proteins were shared (over 90%), ensuring 
      that our cultivar could be used as a representative genome. However, A. bisporus 
      suffers from browning even from only a slight mechanical stimulus during 
      transportation, which significantly lowers its commercial value. To identify 
      which genes respond to a mechanical stimulus that induces browning, we performed 
      a time-course transcriptome analysis based on the de novo assembled genome. 
      Mechanical stimulus induces up-regulation in long fatty acid ligase 
      activity-related genes, as well as melanin biosynthesis genes, especially at 
      early time points. In summary, we assembled the chromosome-level genomic 
      information on a Korean strain of A. bisporus and identified which genes respond 
      to a mechanical stimulus, which provided key hints for improving the post-harvest 
      biological control of A. bisporus.

TI  - An Association Study of DNA Methylation and Gene Expression in Angelman Syndrome: 
      A Bioinformatics Approach.
LID - 10.3390/ijms23169139 [doi]
LID - 9139
AB  - Angelman syndrome (AS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by the loss of 
      function of the E3-ligase UBE3A. Despite multiple studies, AS pathophysiology is 
      still obscure and has mostly been explored in rodent models of the disease. In 
      recent years, a growing body of studies has utilized omics datasets in the 
      attempt to focus research regarding the pathophysiology of AS. Here, for the 
      first time, we utilized a multi-omics approach at the epigenomic level and the 
      transcriptome level, for human-derived neurons. Using publicly available datasets 
      for DNA methylation and gene expression, we found genome regions in proximity to 
      gene promoters and intersecting with gene-body regions that were differentially 
      methylated and differentially expressed in AS. We found that overall, the genome 
      in AS postmortem brain tissue was hypo-methylated compared to healthy controls. 
      We also found more upregulated genes than downregulated genes in AS. Many of 
      these dysregulated genes in neurons obtained from AS patients are known to be 
      critical for neuronal development and synaptic functioning. Taken together, our 
      results suggest a list of dysregulated genes that may be involved in AS 
      development and its pathological features. Moreover, these genes might also have 
      a role in neurodevelopmental disorders similar to AS.

TI  - Gene-microRNA Network Analysis Identified Seven Hub Genes in Association with 
      Progression and Prognosis in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.
LID - 10.3390/genes13081480 [doi]
LID - 1480
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths in the world and 
      is usually divided into non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small cell lung 
      cancer. NSCLC is dominant and accounts for 85% of the total cases. Currently, the 
      therapeutic method of NSCLC is not so satisfactory, and thus identification of 
      new biomarkers is critical for new clinical therapy for this disease. METHODS: 
      Datasets of miRNA and gene expression were obtained from the NCBI database. The 
      differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and miRNAs (DEMs) were analyzed by GEO2R 
      tools. The DEG-DEM interaction was built via miRNA-targeted genes by miRWalk. 
      Several hub genes were selected via network topological analysis in Cytoscape. 
      RESULTS: A set of 276 genes were found to be significantly differentially 
      expressed in the three datasets. Functional enrichment by the DAVID tool showed 
      that these 276 DEGs were significantly enriched in the term "cancer", with a 
      statistic p-value of 1.9 × 10(-5). The subdivision analysis of the specific 
      cancer types indicated that "lung cancer" occupies the largest category with a 
      p-value of 2 × 10(-3). Furthermore, 75 miRNAs were shown to be differentially 
      expressed in three representative datasets. A group of 13 DEGs was selected by 
      analysis of the miRNA-gene interaction of these DEGs and DEMs. The investigation 
      of these 13 genes by GEPIA tools showed that eight of them had consistent results 
      with NSCLC samples in the TCGA database. In addition, we applied the KMplot to 
      conduct the survival analysis of these eight genes and found that seven of them 
      have a significant effect on the prognosis survival of patients. We believe that 
      this study could provide effective research clues for the prevention and 
      treatment of non-small cell lung cancer.

TI  - Analysis of Common SNPs across Continents Reveals Major Genomic Differences 
      between Human Populations.
LID - 10.3390/genes13081472 [doi]
LID - 1472
AB  - Common alleles tend to be more ancient than rare alleles. These common SNPs 
      appeared thousands of years ago and reflect intricate human evolution including 
      various adaptations, admixtures, and migration events. Eighty-four thousand 
      abundant region-specific alleles (ARSAs) that are common in one continent but 
      absent in the rest of the world have been characterized by processing 3100 
      genomes from 230 populations. Also computed were 17,446 polymorphic sites with 
      regional absence of common alleles (RACAs), which are widespread globally but 
      absent in one region. A majority of these region-specific SNPs were found in 
      Africa. America has the second greatest number of ARSAs (3348) and is even ahead 
      of Europe (1911). Surprisingly, East Asia has the highest number of RACAs 
      (10,524) and the lowest number of ARSAs (362). ARSAs and RACAs have distinct 
      compositions of ancestral versus derived alleles in different geographical 
      regions, reflecting their unique evolution. Genes associated with ARSA and RACA 
      SNPs were identified and their functions were analyzed. The core 100 genes shared 
      by multiple populations and associated with region-specific natural selection 
      were examined. The largest part of them (42%) are related to the nervous system. 
      ARSA and RACA SNPs are important for both association and human evolution 
      studies.

AB  - The evident implication of the insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) in Alzheimer's 
      disease (AD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), among its capacity to degrade 
      insulin and amyloid-β peptide (Aβ), suggests that IDE could be an essential link 
      in the relation between hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance and AD. However, 
      little is known about the cellular and molecular regulation of IDE expression, 
      and even less has been explored regarding the post-transcriptional regulation of 
      IDE, although it represents a great molecular target of interest for therapeutic 
      treatments. We recently described that miR-7, a novel candidate for linking AD 
      and T2DM at the molecular level, regulates IDE and other key genes in both 
      pathologies, including some key genes involved in the insulin signaling pathway. 
      Here, we explored whether other miRNAs as well as other post-transcriptional 
      regulators, such as RNA binding proteins (RBP), could potentially participate in 
      the regulation of IDE expression in vitro. Our data showed that in addition to 
      miR-7, miR-125, miR-490 and miR-199 regulate IDE expression at the 
      post-transcriptional level. Moreover, we also found that IDE contains multiple 
      potential binding sites for several RBPs, and a narrow-down prediction analysis 
      led us to speculate on a novel regulation of IDE by RALY and HuD. Taken together, 
      these results demonstrate the novel players controlling IDE expression that could 
      represent potential therapeutical targets to treat several metabolic diseases 
      with a high impact on human health, including AD and T2DM.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The determination of miRNA-mRNA pairs for intervertebral disc 
      degeneration (IVDD) regulated by pro-inflammatory cytokines were investigated. 
      METHODS: Two dataset (accession number GSE27494 and GSE41883 from platform 
      GPL1352) of expression profiling was downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus 
      (GEO). The annulus cells were isolated from annulus fibrosus in patients with 
      degenerative disc disease. The cells were then cultured in a three-dimensional 
      (3D) collagen containing with/without proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis 
      factor alpha (TNF-α) or interleukin beta (IL-1β)). After being cultured for 
      14 days, the isolated total RNA was analyzed via microarray, and the expression 
      array data were obtained using BRB-Array Tools followed by analyzing the 
      differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and the prediction of potential miRNA 
      targets of hub genes through online database. RESULTS: Firstly, 52 and 296 DEGs 
      were found in IL-1β- and TNF-α-induced annulus cells, respectively, of these 
      there had 42 common DEGs (co-DEGs) with 34 increased transcripts and 8 reduced 
      ones. Based on the GO and KEGG software, these co-DEGs were mainly enriched in 
      the response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and molecule of bacterial origin, the 
      regulation of receptor ligand activity and signaling receptor activator activity, 
      as well as the following signaling pathways, including TNF signaling pathway, 
      IL-17 signaling pathway, and NF-κB signaling pathway. Top hub genes (CXCL1, 
      CXCL2, CXCL8, IL1Β and PTGS2) regulated by several potential microRNAs were 
      involved in TNF-α/IL-1β treated annulus cells. CONCLUSIONS: Several candidate 
      genes regulated by miRNAs caused by TNF-α/IL-1β in the annulus cells were found, 
      which will guide diagnosis and treatment for degenerative disc disease.

AB  - Position weight matrix (PWM) is the traditional motif model representing the 
      transcription factor (TF) binding sites. It proposes that the positions 
      contribute independently to TFs binding affinity, although this hypothesis does 
      not fit the data perfectly. This explains why PWM hits are missing in a 
      substantial fraction of ChIP-seq peaks. To study various modes of the direct 
      binding of plant TFs, we compiled the benchmark collection of 111 ChIP-seq 
      datasets for Arabidopsis thaliana, and applied the traditional PWM, and two 
      alternative motif models BaMM and SiteGA, proposing the dependencies of the 
      positions. The variation in the stringency of the recognition thresholds for the 
      models proposed that the hits of PWM, BaMM, and SiteGA models are associated with 
      the sites of high/medium, any, and low affinity, respectively. At the medium 
      recognition threshold, about 60% of ChIP-seq peaks contain PWM hits consisting of 
      conserved core consensuses, while BaMM and SiteGA provide hits for an additional 
      15% of peaks in which a weaker core consensus is compensated through intra-motif 
      dependencies. The presence/absence of these dependencies in the motifs of 
      alternative/traditional models was confirmed by the dependency logo DepLogo 
      visualizing the position-wise partitioning of the alignments of predicted sites. 
      We exemplify the detailed analysis of ChIP-seq profiles for plant TFs CCA1, MYC2, 
      and SEP3. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis revealed that among the three 
      motif models, the SiteGA had the highest portions of genes with the significantly 
      enriched GO terms among all predicted genes. We showed that both alternative 
      motif models provide for traditional PWM greater extensions in predicted sites 
      for TFs MYC2/SEP3 with condition/tissue specific functions, compared to those for 
      TF CCA1 with housekeeping functions. Overall, the combined application of 
      standard and alternative motif models is beneficial to detect various modes of 
      the direct TF-DNA interactions in the maximal portion of ChIP-seq loci.

PG  - 1954-1969
LID - 10.21037/tcr-22-398 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is one of the common 
      malignant tumors worldwide. There is still a lack of effective diagnostic and 
      therapeutic targets for the recurrence and metastasis of ccRCC. In this study, we 
      sought to identify effective diagnostic and therapeutic targets for ccRCC 
      recurrence and metastasis. METHODS: Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) dataset was 
      used to obtain differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between primary and 
      metastasis ccRCC. We used The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), GeneMANIA, cBioPortal, 
      MethSurv, and TIMER to analyze the expression differences, mutation status, 
      prognostic value, molecular function, and immune infiltration of hub genes in 
      renal cell carcinoma (RCC). RESULTS: We obtained a total of 35 different gene 
      lists. Six collagen family members were identified as hub genes. The expression 
      level of collagen family members was closely related to ccRCC. Moreover, 
      differences in the expression levels of collagen family members were closely 
      related to the stage and prognosis of ccRCC. Members of the collagen family were 
      responsible for more than 15% of the genetic alterations in ccRCC and are 
      involved in multiple signaling pathways. The expression level of collagen family 
      members was closely related to the infiltration of tumor-associated immune cells. 
      Univariate and multivariate Cox regression identified the prognosis-related 
      genes: COL5A1. CONCLUSIONS: Our study implied that members of the collagen family 
      may serve as a biomarker for ccRCC metastasis and prognosis.

      expansion of adipose tissue accompanied by hypoxia and inflammatory signalling. 
      Investigation in human subcutaneous white adipose tissue (scWAT) in people living 
      with obesity in which metabolic complications such as insulin resistance are yet 
      to manifest is limited, and the mechanisms by which these processes are 
      dysregulated are not well elucidated. Long chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty 
      acids (LC n-3 PUFAs) have been shown to modulate the expression of genes 
      associated with lipid accumulation and collagen deposition and reduce the number 
      of inflammatory macrophages in adipose tissue from individuals with insulin 
      resistance. Therefore, these lipids may have positive actions on obesity 
      associated scWAT hypertrophy and inflammation. METHODS: To evaluate 
      obesity-associated tissue remodelling and responses to LC n-3 PUFAs, abdominal 
      scWAT biopsies were collected from normal weight individuals and those living 
      with obesity prior to and following 12-week intervention with marine LC n-3 PUFAs 
      (1.1 g EPA + 0.8 g DHA daily). RNA sequencing, qRT-PCR, and histochemical 
      staining were used to assess remodelling- and inflammatory-associated gene 
      expression, tissue morphology and macrophage infiltration. RESULTS: Obesity was 
      associated with scWAT hypertrophy (P < 0.001), hypoxia, remodelling, and 
      inflammatory macrophage infiltration (P = 0.023). Furthermore, we highlight the 
      novel dysregulation of Wnt signalling in scWAT in non-insulin resistant obesity. 
      LC n-3 PUFAs beneficially modulated the scWAT environment through downregulating 
      the expression of genes associated with inflammatory and remodelling pathways (P 
      <0.001), but there were altered outcomes in individuals living with obesity in 
      comparison to normal weight individuals. CONCLUSION: Our data identify 
      dysregulation of Wnt signalling, hypoxia, and hypertrophy, and enhanced 
      macrophage infiltration in scWAT in non-insulin resistant obesity. LC n-3 PUFAs 
      modulate some of these processes, especially in normal weight individuals which 
      may be preventative and limit the development of restrictive and inflammatory 
      scWAT in the development of obesity. We conclude that a higher dose or longer 
      duration of LC n-3 PUFA intervention may be needed to reduce obesity-associated 
      scWAT inflammation and promote tissue homeostasis. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION:

TI  - Spotlight on Exosomal Non-Coding RNAs in Breast Cancer: An In Silico Analysis to 
      Identify Potential lncRNA/circRNA-miRNA-Target Axis.
LID - 10.3390/ijms23158351 [doi]
LID - 8351
AB  - Breast cancer (BC) has recently become the most common cancer type worldwide, 
      with metastatic disease being the main reason for disease mortality. This has 
      brought about strategies for early detection, especially the utilization of 
      minimally invasive biomarkers found in various bodily fluids. Exosomes have been 
      proposed as novel extracellular vesicles, readily detectable in bodily fluids, 
      secreted from BC-cells or BC-tumor microenvironment cells, and capable of 
      conferring cellular signals over long distances via various cargo molecules. This 
      cargo is composed of different biomolecules, among which are the novel non-coding 
      genome products, such as microRNAs (miRNAs), long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), and 
      the recently discovered circular RNA (circRNA), all of which were found to be 
      implicated in BC pathology. In this review, the diverse roles of the ncRNA cargo 
      of BC-derived exosomes will be discussed, shedding light on their primarily 
      oncogenic and additionally tumor suppressor roles at different levels of BC tumor 
      progression, and drug sensitivity/resistance, along with presenting their 
      diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive biomarker potential. Finally, benefiting 
      from the miRNA sponging mechanism of action of lncRNAs and circRNAs, we 
      established an experimentally validated breast cancer exosomal non-coding 
      RNAs-regulated target gene axis from already published exosomal ncRNAs in BC. The 
      resulting genes, pathways, gene ontology (GO) terms, and Kyoto Encyclopedia of 
      Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis could be a starting point to better understand 
      BC and may pave the way for the development of novel diagnostic and prognostic 
      biomarkers and therapeutics.

TI  - Nuclear Receptor Atlases of Choroidal Tissues Reveal Candidate Receptors 
      Associated with Age-Related Macular Degeneration.
LID - 10.3390/cells11152386 [doi]
LID - 2386
AB  - The choroid is a vulnerable tissue site in the eye, impacted in several blinding 
      diseases including age related macular degeneration (AMD), which is the leading 
      cause of central vision loss in the aging population. Choroidal thinning and 
      choriocapillary dropout are features of the early form of AMD, and endothelial 
      dysfunction and vascular changes are primary characteristics of the neovascular 
      clinical sub-type of AMD. Given the importance, the choroidal endothelium and 
      outer vasculature play in supporting visual function, a better understanding of 
      baseline choroidal signaling pathways engaged in tissue and cellular homeostasis 
      is needed. Nuclear receptors are a large family of transcription factors 
      responsible for maintaining various cellular processes during development, aging 
      and disease. Herein we developed a comprehensive nuclear receptor atlas of human 
      choroidal endothelial cells and freshly isolated choroidal tissue by examining 
      the expression levels of all members of this transcription family using 
      quantitative real time PCR. Given the close relationship between the choroid and 
      retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), this data was cross-referenced with the 
      expression profile of nuclear receptors in human RPE cells, to discover potential 
      overlap versus cell-specific nuclear receptor expression. Finally, to identify 
      candidate receptors that may participate in the pathobiology of AMD, we cataloged 
      nuclear receptor expression in a murine model of wet AMD, from which we 
      discovered a subset of nuclear receptors differentially regulated following 
      neovascularization. Overall, these databases serve as useful resources 
      establishing the influence of nuclear receptor signaling pathways on the outer 
      vascular tissue of the eye, while providing a list of receptors, for more focused 
      investigations in the future, to determine their suitability as potential 
      therapeutic targets for diseases, in which the choroid is affected.

AB  - Budesonide (Bud), one of the most widely used lung medicines, is currently used 
      as a repurposing medicine for immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) treatment. The 
      progression of IgAN is related to inflammation involving macrophages and 
      podocytes. The present study aimed to explore the effects of Bud on classically 
      activated (M1)/alternatively activated (M2) macrophage polarization and podocyte 
      injury under lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory stress in vitro. 
      Anti-inflammatory bioinformation of Bud was identified based on the Gene 
      Expression Omnibus database. RAW264.7 cells were treated with normal medium, LPS, 
      curcumin (Cur, positive control), or Bud 5, 10, or 20 µM. The expression levels 
      of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), TNF-α, mannose receptor (CD206) and 
      arginase (Arg)-1 were quantified by western blotting. The collected supernatants 
      from macrophages were termed (Nor)MS, (LPS)MS, (Cur)MS and (Bud)MS. The TNF-α, 
      IL-1β and nitric oxide (NO) levels in the supernatants were evaluated by ELISA 
      and Griess assay. The podocytes were cultured in different supernatants and their 
      survival rates were assessed by bromodeoxyuridine assay. TNF signaling is an 
      important pathway by which Bud exerts anti-inflammatory activities. Compared with 
      the LPS group, 5, 10 and 20 µM Bud significantly increased Arg-1 and decreased 
      iNOS expression (Six: P<0.05) and 20 µM Bud significantly increased Arg-1 and 
      CD206 and decreased iNOS and TNF-α expression (Four: P<0.05). Cur significantly 
      decreased iNOS and TNF-α expression (Two: P<0.05). Compared with LPS, 5, 10 and 
      20 µM Bud and Cur significantly decreased TNF-α, IL-1β and NO levels (All: 
      P<0.05). The podocyte survival rates of (Bud)MS and (Cur)MS were significantly 
      higher than those of (LPS)MS (Four: P<0.05). The protective effect of Bud on 
      podocyte injury is related to its modulation of M1/M2 polarization.

TI  - mTORC1 controls Golgi architecture and vesicle secretion by phosphorylation of 
      SCYL1.
PG  - 4685
LID - 10.1038/s41467-022-32487-7 [doi]
LID - 4685
AB  - The protein kinase mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is a master 
      regulator of cell growth and proliferation, supporting anabolic reactions and 
      inhibiting catabolic pathways like autophagy. Its hyperactivation is a frequent 
      event in cancer promoting tumor cell proliferation. Several intracellular 
      membrane-associated mTORC1 pools have been identified, linking its function to 
      distinct subcellular localizations. Here, we characterize the N-terminal 
      kinase-like protein SCYL1 as a Golgi-localized target through which mTORC1 
      controls organelle distribution and extracellular vesicle secretion in breast 
      cancer cells. Under growth conditions, SCYL1 is phosphorylated by mTORC1 on 
      Ser754, supporting Golgi localization. Upon mTORC1 inhibition, Ser754 
      dephosphorylation leads to SCYL1 displacement to endosomes. Peripheral, 
      dephosphorylated SCYL1 causes Golgi enlargement, redistribution of early and late 
      endosomes and increased extracellular vesicle release. Thus, the 
      mTORC1-controlled phosphorylation status of SCYL1 is an important determinant 
      regulating subcellular distribution and function of endolysosomal compartments. 
      It may also explain the pathophysiology underlying human genetic diseases such as 
      CALFAN syndrome, which is caused by loss-of-function of SCYL1.

TI  - LAP3 contributes to IFN-γ-induced arginine depletion and malignant transformation

AB  - BACKGROUND: IFN-γ has been traditionally recognized as an inflammatory cytokine 
      that involves in inflammation and autoimmune diseases. Previously we have shown 
      that sustained IFN-γ induced malignant transformation of bovine mammary 
      epithelial cells (BMECs) via arginine depletion. However, the molecular mechanism 
      underlying this is still unknown. METHODS: In this study, the amino acids 
      contents in BMECs were quantified by a targeted metabolomics method. The 
      acquisition of differentially expressed genes was mined from RNA-seq dataset and 
      analyzed bioinformatically. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain 
      reaction (qRT-PCR), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), western blotting, 
      and immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay were performed to detect gene mRNA and 
      protein expression levels. CCK-8 and would healing assays were used to detect 
      cell proliferation and migration abilities, respectively. Cell cycle phase 
      alternations were analyzed by flow cytometry. RESULTS: The targeted metabolomics 
      analysis specifically discovered IFN-γ induced arginine depletion through 
      accelerating arginine catabolism and inhibiting arginine anabolism in BMECs. 
      Transcriptome analysis identified leucine aminopeptidase 3 (LAP3), which was 
      regulated by p38 and ERK MAPKs, to downregulate arginine level through 
      interfering with argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS1) as IFN-γ stimulated. 
      Moreover, LAP3 also contributed to IFN-γ-induced malignant transformation of 
      BMECs by upregulation of HDAC2 (histone deacetylase 2) expression and promotion 
      of cell cycle proteins cyclin A1 and D1 expressions. Arginine supplementation did 
      not affect LAP3 and HDAC2 expressions, but slowed down cell cycle process of 
      malignant BMECs. In clinical samples of patients with breast cancer, LAP3 was 
      confirmed to be upregulated, while ASS1 was downregulated compared with healthy 
      control. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrated that LAP3 mediated IFN-γ-induced 
      arginine depletion to malignant transformation of BMECs. Our findings provide a 
      potential therapeutic target for breast cancer both in humans and dairy cows.

TI  - Coprophagy Prevention Decreases the Reproductive Performance and Granulosa Cell 
      Apoptosis via Regulation of CTSB Gene in Rabbits.

LID - 926795
AB  - Coprophagy is an instinctive behavior in rabbit with important effects on growth 
      and reproductive performance. The underlying mechanism of this effect in rabbit 
      is unknown. Here, we used Elizabeth circle as a coprophagy preventing model in 
      female rabbits and assess feed intake, growth, and reproductive performance. We 
      found that preventing coprophagy did not affect feed intake but decreased body 
      weight and weight of several organs and tissues and resulted in complete 
      reproductive failure during the late pregnancy period, accompanied by reduced 
      levels of plasma progesterone. RNA-seq analysis of rabbit ovarian tissues 
      revealed that preventing coprophagy affected significantly 241 genes (DEGs), with 
      the large majority being downregulated. Bioinformatic analyses revealed that 
      those DEGs are mostly involved in apoptosis, immune response, and metabolic 
      pathways. Among DEGs, the lysosomal cysteine protease cathepsin B (CTSB) was 
      significantly downregulated in the coprophagy prevention group. Further studies 
      using siRNA and adenovirus overexpression systems revealed that CTSB promotes the 
      proliferation of rabbit granulosa cells (GCS) and prevents apoptosis. Measurement 
      of transcripts coding for proteins related to apoptosis revealed a minor 
      transcriptomic effect of CTSB, indicating that its effect is likely 
      post-transcriptional. Overexpression of CTSB increased secretion of progesterone 
      and estradiol, partly via upregulation of CYP19A1 while inhibition of CTSB 
      decreased progesterone secretion partly via downregulation of the StAR gene. In 
      conclusion, our study demonstrated the detrimental effect on reproduction by 
      preventing coprophagy with a main role for this response played by CTSB on the 
      granulosa cells of the ovary.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Melanomas are skin malignant tumors that arise from melanocytes which 
      are primarily treated with surgery, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, 
      immunotherapy, radiation therapy, etc. Targeted therapy is a promising approach 
      to treating advanced melanomas, but resistance always occurs. This study is aimed 
      at identifying the potential target genes and candidate drugs for drug-resistant 
      melanoma effectively with computational methods. METHODS: Identification of genes 
      associated with drug-resistant melanomas was conducted using the text mining tool 
      pubmed2ensembl. Further gene screening was carried out by GO and KEGG pathway 
      enrichment analyses. The PPI network was constructed using STRING database and 
      Cytoscape. GEPIA was used to perform the survival analysis and conduct the 
      Kaplan-Meier curve. Drugs targeted at these genes were selected in 
      Pharmaprojects. The binding affinity scores of drug-target interactions were 
      predicted by DeepPurpose. RESULTS: A total of 433 genes were found associated 
      with drug-resistant melanomas by text mining. The most statistically differential 
      functional enriched pathways of GO and KEGG analyses contained 348 genes, and 27 
      hub genes were further screened out by MCODE in Cytoscape. Six genes were 
      identified with statistical differences after survival analysis and literature 
      review. 16 candidate drugs targeted at hub genes were found by Pharmaprojects 
      under our restrictions. Finally, 11 ERBB2-targeted drugs with top affinity scores 
      were predicted by DeepPurpose, including 10 ERBB2 kinase inhibitors and 1 
      antibody-drug conjugate. CONCLUSION: Text mining and bioinformatics are valuable 
      methods for gene identification in drug discovery. DeepPurpose is an efficient 
      and operative deep learning tool for predicting the DTI and selecting the 
      candidate drugs.

AB  - Mechanisms governing regional human adipose tissue (AT) development remain 
      undefined. Here, we show that the long non-coding RNA HOTAIR (HOX transcript 
      antisense RNA) is exclusively expressed in gluteofemoral AT, where it is 
      essential for adipocyte development. We find that HOTAIR interacts with polycomb 
      repressive complex 2 (PRC2) and we identify core HOTAIR-PRC2 target genes 
      involved in adipocyte lineage determination. Repression of target genes coincides 
      with PRC2 promoter occupancy and H3K27 trimethylation. HOTAIR is also involved in 
      modifying the gluteal adipocyte transcriptome through alternative splicing. 
      Gluteal-specific expression of HOTAIR is maintained by defined regions of open 
      chromatin across the HOTAIR promoter. HOTAIR expression levels can be modified by 
      hormonal (estrogen, glucocorticoids) and genetic variation (rs1443512 is a HOTAIR 
      eQTL associated with reduced gynoid fat mass). These data identify HOTAIR as a 
      dynamic regulator of the gluteal adipocyte transcriptome and epigenome with 
      functional importance for human regional AT development.

TI  - Identification of Critical Genes and Pathways for Influenza A Virus Infections 
      via Bioinformatics Analysis.
LID - 10.3390/v14081625 [doi]
LID - 1625
AB  - Influenza A virus (IAV) requires the host cellular machinery for many aspects of 
      its life cycle. Knowledge of these host cell requirements not only reveals 
      molecular pathways exploited by the virus or triggered by the immune system but 
      also provides further targets for antiviral drug development. To uncover critical 
      pathways and potential targets of influenza infection, we assembled a large 
      amount of data from 8 RNA sequencing studies of IAV infection for integrative 
      network analysis. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was 
      performed to investigate modules and genes correlated with the time course of 
      infection and/or multiplicity of infection (MOI). Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto 
      Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses were performed to 
      explore the biological functions and pathways of the genes in 5 significant 
      modules. Top hub genes were identified using the cytoHubba plugin in the protein 
      interaction network. The correlation between expression levels of 7 top hub genes 
      and time course or MOI was displayed and validated, including BCL2L13, PLSCR1, 
      ARID5A, LMO2, NDRG4, HAP1, and CARD10. Dysregulated expression of these genes 
      potently impacted the development of IAV infection through modulating IAV-related 
      biological processes and pathways. This study provides further insights into the 
      underlying molecular mechanisms and potential targets in IAV infection.

TI  - GeneToList: A Web Application to Assist with Gene Identifiers for the 
      Non-Bioinformatics-Savvy Scientist.
LID - 10.3390/biology11081113 [doi]
LID - 1113
AB  - The increasing incorporation of omics technologies into biomedical research and 
      translational medicine presents challenges to end users of the large and complex 
      datasets that are generated by these methods. A particular challenge in genomics 
      is that the nomenclature for genes is not uniform between large genomic databases 
      or between commonly used genetic analysis tools. Furthermore, outdated genomic 
      nomenclature can still be found amongst scientific communications, including 
      peer-reviewed manuscripts. Therefore, a web application (GeneToList) was 
      developed to assist in gene ID conversion and alias matching, with a specific 
      focus on achieving a user-friendly interface for the non-bioinformatics-savvy 
      scientist. It currently includes gene information for over 38,000 different taxa 
      retrieved from the National Center for Biotechnology and Information (NCBI) Gene 
      resource. Supported databases of gene IDs include NCBI Gene Symbols, NCBI Gene 
      IDs (Entrez IDs), OMIM IDs, HGNC IDs, Ensembl IDs, and 28 other taxa-specific 
      identifiers. GeneToList is available at genetolist.com. The tool is a web 
      application that is compatible with many standard browsers. The gene ID 
      conversion feature of this application was found to outcompete the common gene ID 
      conversion tools. Specifically, it was able to successfully convert all tested 
      IDs, whereas the others were not able to recognize the gene aliases. Therefore, 
      the gene ID disambiguation provided by this application should be beneficial for 
      many scientists dealing with gene data when the uniformity of gene nomenclature 
      is important for downstream analysis.

TI  - Use of Autoreactive Antibodies in Blood of Patients with Pancreatic Intraductal 
      Papillary Mucinous Neoplasms (IPMN) for Grade Distinction and Detection of 
      Malignancy.
LID - 10.3390/cancers14153562 [doi]
LID - 3562
AB  - (1) Background: A reliable non-invasive distinction between low- and high-risk 
      pancreatic intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN) is needed to 
      effectively detect IPMN with malignant potential. This would improve preventative 
      care and reduce the risk of developing pancreatic cancer and overtreatment. The 
      present study aimed at exploring the presence of autoreactive antibodies in the 
      blood of patients with IPMN of various grades of dysplasia. (2) Methods: A 
      single-center cohort was studied composed of 378 serum samples from patients with 
      low-grade IPMN (n = 91), high-grade IPMN (n = 66), IPMN with associated invasive 
      cancer (n = 30), pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) stages T1 (n = 24) and 
      T2 (n = 113), and healthy controls (n = 54). A 249 full-length recombinant human 
      protein microarray was used for profiling the serum samples. (3) Results: 14 
      proteins were identified as potential biomarkers for grade distinction in IPMN, 
      yielding high specificity but mediocre sensitivity. (4) Conclusions: The 
      identified autoantibodies are potential biomarkers that may assist in the 
      detection of malignancy in IPMN patients.

TI  - Cyclic Hypoxia Induces Transcriptomic Changes in Mast Cells Leading to a 
      Hyperresponsive Phenotype after FcεRI Cross-Linking.
LID - 10.3390/cells11142239 [doi]
LID - 2239
AB  - Mast cells (MCs) play important roles in tumor development, executing pro- or 
      antitumoral functions depending on tumor type and tumor microenvironment (TME) 
      conditions. Cyclic hypoxia (cyH) is a common feature of TME since tumor blood 
      vessels fail to provide a continuous supply of oxygen to the tumor mass. Here, we 
      hypothesized that the localization of MCs in cyH regions within solid tumors 
      could modify their transcriptional profile and activation parameters. Using 
      confocal microscopy, we found an important number of MCs in cyH zones of murine 
      melanoma B16-F1 tumors. Applying microarray analysis to examine the transcriptome 
      of murine bone-marrow-derived MCs (BMMCs) exposed to interleaved cycles of 
      hypoxia and re-oxygenation, we identified altered expression of 2512 genes. 
      Functional enrichment analysis revealed that the transcriptional signature of MCs 
      exposed to cyH is associated with oxidative phosphorylation and the FcεRI 
      signaling pathway. Interestingly, FcεRI-dependent degranulation, calcium 
      mobilization, and PLC-γ activity, as well as Tnf-α, Il-4, and Il-2 gene 
      expression after IgE/antigen challenge were increased in BMMCs exposed to cyH 
      compared with those maintained in normoxia. Taken together, our findings indicate 
      that cyH causes an important phenotypic change in MCs that should be considered 
      in the design of inflammation-targeted therapies to control tumor growth.

TI  - High-Throughput Proteomic Analysis of Human Dermal Fibroblast Response to 
      Different Blood Derivatives: Autologous Topical Serum Derived from Plasma Rich in 
      Growth Factors (PRGF) versus Leukocyte- and Platelet-Rich Plasma (L-PRP).

AB  - Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is nowadays used in the treatment of different types 
      of cutaneous lesions. However, different compositions can influence clinical 
      outcomes. Among them, the inclusion of leukocytes is controversial. 
      High-throughput proteomics techniques were used to analyze the proteins that are 
      differentially expressed in human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs) after treatment for 
      24 h with two PRP types, autologous topical serum (Endoret serum-ES) derived from 
      plasma rich in growth factors (PRGF) and leukocyte- and platelet-rich plasma 
      (L-PRP). The identified proteins were then classified by both Gene Ontology and 
      Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. The obtained results show that the compositions of ES 
      and L-PRP differ in such a way that they induce different responses in HDFs. 
      ES-treated HDFs overexpress growth factor-related proteins, leading to protein 
      synthesis, cell proliferation and migration. By contrast, L-PRP treatment induces 
      a response similar to that caused by proinflammatory molecules. These data could 
      explain the contradictory clinical results obtained for the different types of 
      PRP, especially with respect to their leukocyte contents.

TI  - Proteomic Analysis of Methanococcus voltae Grown in the Presence of Mineral and 
      Nonmineral Sources of Iron and Sulfur.
PG  - e0189322

LID - e01893-22
AB  - Iron sulfur (Fe-S) proteins are essential and ubiquitous across all domains of 
      life, yet the mechanisms underpinning assimilation of iron (Fe) and sulfur (S) 
      and biogenesis of Fe-S clusters are poorly understood. This is particularly true 
      for anaerobic methanogenic archaea, which are known to employ more Fe-S proteins 
      than other prokaryotes. Here, we utilized a deep proteomics analysis of 
      Methanococcus voltae A3 cultured in the presence of either synthetic pyrite 
      (FeS(2)) or aqueous forms of ferrous iron and sulfide to elucidate physiological 
      responses to growth on mineral or nonmineral sources of Fe and S. The liquid 
      chromatography-mass spectrometry (LCMS) shotgun proteomics analysis included 77% 
      of the predicted proteome. Through a comparative analysis of intra- and 
      extracellular proteomes, candidate proteins associated with FeS(2) reductive 
      dissolution, Fe and S acquisition, and the subsequent transport, trafficking, and 
      storage of Fe and S were identified. The proteomic response shows a large and 
      balanced change, suggesting that M. voltae makes physiological adjustments 
      involving a range of biochemical processes based on the available nutrient 
      source. Among the proteins differentially regulated were members of core 
      methanogenesis, oxidoreductases, membrane proteins putatively involved in 
      transport, Fe-S binding ferredoxin and radical S-adenosylmethionine proteins, 
      ribosomal proteins, and intracellular proteins involved in Fe-S cluster assembly 
      and storage. This work improves our understanding of ancient biogeochemical 
      processes and can support efforts in biomining of minerals. IMPORTANCE Clusters 
      of iron and sulfur are key components of the active sites of enzymes that 
      facilitate microbial conversion of light or electrical energy into chemical 
      bonds. The proteins responsible for transporting iron and sulfur into cells and 
      assembling these elements into metal clusters are not well understood. Using a 
      microorganism that has an unusually high demand for iron and sulfur, we conducted 
      a global investigation of cellular proteins and how they change based on the 
      mineral forms of iron and sulfur. Understanding this process will answer 
      questions about life on early earth and has application in biomining and 
      sustainable sources of energy.

TI  - Marine Synechococcus sp. Strain WH7803 Shows Specific Adaptative Responses to 
      Assimilate Nanomolar Concentrations of Nitrate.
PG  - e0018722
LID - 10.1128/spectrum.00187-22 [doi]
LID - e00187-22
AB  - Marine Synechococcus, together with Prochlorococcus, contribute to a significant 
      proportion of the primary production on Earth. The spatial distribution of these 
      two groups of marine picocyanobacteria depends on different factors such as 
      nutrient availability and temperature. Some Synechococcus ecotypes thrive in 
      mesotrophic and moderately oligotrophic waters, where they exploit both oxidized 
      and reduced forms of nitrogen. Here, we present a comprehensive study, which 
      includes transcriptomic and proteomic analyses of the response of Synechococcus 
      sp. strain WH7803 to nanomolar concentrations of nitrate, compared to micromolar 
      ammonium or nitrogen starvation. We found that Synechococcus has a specific 
      response to a nanomolar nitrate concentration that differs from the response 
      shown under nitrogen starvation or the presence of standard concentrations of 
      either ammonium or nitrate. This fact suggests that the particular response to 
      the uptake of nanomolar concentrations of nitrate could be an evolutionary 
      advantage for marine Synechococcus against Prochlorococcus in the natural 
      environment. IMPORTANCE Marine Synechococcus are a very abundant group of 
      photosynthetic organisms on our planet. Previous studies have shown blooms of 
      these organisms when nanomolar concentrations of nitrate become available. We 
      have assessed the effect of nanomolar nitrate concentrations by studying the 
      transcriptome and proteome of Synechococcus sp. WH7803, together with some 
      physiological parameters. We found evidence that Synechococcus sp. strain WH7803 
      does sense and react to nanomolar concentrations of nitrate, suggesting the 
      occurrence of specific adaptive mechanisms to allow their utilization. Thus, very 
      low concentrations of nitrate in the ocean seem to be a significant nitrogen 
      source for marine picocyanobacteria.

AB  - Human skin comprises stratified squamous epithelium and dermis with various 
      stromal cells and the extracellular matrix (ECM). The basement membrane (BM), a 
      thin layer at the top of the dermis, serves as a unique niche for determining the 
      fate of epidermal stem cells (EpSCs) by transmitting physical and biochemical 
      signals to establish epidermal cell polarity and maintain the hierarchical 
      structure and function of skin tissue. However, how stem cell niches maintain 
      tissue homeostasis and control wound healing by regulating the behavior of EpSCs 
      is still not completely understood. In this study, a hierarchical skin proteome 
      map is constructed using spatial quantitative proteomics combined with 
      decellularization, laser capture microdissection, and mass spectrometry. The 
      specific functions of different structures of normal native skin tissues or 
      tissues with a dermatologic disease are analyzed in situ. Transforming growth 
      factor-beta (TGFβ)-induced protein ig-h3 (TGFBI), an ECM glycoprotein, in the BM 
      is identified that could enhance the growth and function of EpSCs and promote 
      wound healing. Our results provide insights into the way in which ECM proteins 
      facilitate the growth and function of EpSCs as part of an important niche. The 
      results may benefit the clinical treatment of skin ulcers or diseases with 
      refractory lesions that involve epidermal cell dysfunction and 
      re-epithelialization block in the future.

AB  - The mechanisms of incomplete penetrance of risk-modifying impacts of 
      apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε2 and ε4 alleles on Alzheimer's disease (AD) have not 
      been fully understood. We performed genome-wide analysis of differences in 
      linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns between 6,136 AD-affected and 10,555 
      AD-unaffected subjects from five independent studies to explore whether the 
      association of the APOE ε2 allele (encoded by rs7412 polymorphism) and ε4 allele 
      (encoded by rs429358 polymorphism) with AD was modulated by autosomal 
      polymorphisms. The LD analysis identified 24 (mostly inter-chromosomal) and 57 
      (primarily intra-chromosomal) autosomal polymorphisms with significant 
      differences in LD with either rs7412 or rs429358, respectively, between 
      AD-affected and AD-unaffected subjects, indicating their potential modulatory 
      roles. Our Cox regression analysis showed that minor alleles of four 
      inter-chromosomal and ten intra-chromosomal polymorphisms exerted significant 
      modulating effects on the ε2- and ε4-associated AD risks, respectively, and 
      identified ε2-independent (rs2884183 polymorphism, 11q22.3) and ε4-independent 
      (rs483082 polymorphism, 19q13.32) associations with AD. Our functional analysis 
      highlighted ε2- and/or ε4-linked processes affecting the lipid and lipoprotein 
      metabolism and cell junction organization which may contribute to AD 
      pathogenesis. These findings provide insights into the ε2- and ε4-associated 
      mechanisms of AD pathogenesis, underlying their incomplete penetrance.

TI  - Investigation Driven by Network Pharmacology on Potential Components and 
      Mechanism of DGS, a Natural Vasoprotective Combination, for the Phytotherapy of 
      Coronary Artery Disease.
LID - 10.3390/molecules27134075 [doi]
LID - 4075
AB  - Phytotherapy offers obvious advantages in the intervention of Coronary Artery 
      Disease (CAD), but it is difficult to clarify the working mechanisms of the 
      medicinal materials it uses. DGS is a natural vasoprotective combination that was 
      screened out in our previous research, yet its potential components and 
      mechanisms are unknown. Therefore, in this study, HPLC-MS and network 
      pharmacology were employed to identify the active components and key signaling 
      pathways of DGS. Transgenic zebrafish and HUVECs cell assays were used to 
      evaluate the effectiveness of DGS. A total of 37 potentially active compounds 
      were identified that interacted with 112 potential targets of CAD. Furthermore, 
      PI3K-Akt, MAPK, relaxin, VEGF, and other signal pathways were determined to be 
      the most promising DGS-mediated pathways. NO kit, ELISA, and Western blot results 
      showed that DGS significantly promoted NO and VEGFA secretion via the 
      upregulation of VEGFR2 expression and the phosphorylation of Akt, Erk1/2, and 
      eNOS to cause angiogenesis and vasodilation. The result of dynamics molecular 
      docking indicated that Salvianolic acid C may be a key active component of DGS in 
      the treatment of CAD. In conclusion, this study has shed light on the network 
      molecular mechanism of DGS for the intervention of CAD using a network 
      pharmacology-driven strategy for the first time to aid in the intervention of 
      CAD.

TI  - Differences in Antioxidant and Lipid Handling Protein Expression Influence How 
      Cells Expressing Distinct Mutant TP53 Subtypes Maintain Iron Homeostasis.
LID - 10.3390/cells11132064 [doi]
LID - 2064
AB  - The tumor suppressor TP53 is the most commonly mutated gene in human cancers, and 
      iron is necessary for cancer cell growth and proliferation, but there is a 
      significant gap in knowledge for how the two cooperate to affect cellular 
      physiology. Elucidating this role is complicated, however, because each TP53 
      mutation subtype exhibits unique phenotypic responses to changes in iron 
      availability. The goal of this work was to determine how cells expressing 
      distinct TP53 mutation subtypes respond to iron restriction. Utilizing a reverse 
      genetics approach, we generated eight isogenic cell lines that either lacked TP53 
      expression, expressed wild-type TP53, or expressed one of the six most common 
      TP53 "hotspot" mutations. We then employed isobaric peptide labeling and mass 
      spectrometry to quantitively measure changes in global protein expression, both 
      in response to induction of mutant TP53 expression, and in response to iron 
      chelation. Our findings indicate that mutant TP53-dependent sensitivities to iron 
      restriction are not driven by differences in responsiveness to iron chelation, 
      but more so by mutant TP53-dependent differences in cellular antioxidant and 
      lipid handling protein expression. These findings reinforce the importance of 
      distinguishing between TP53 mutation subtypes when investigating approaches to 
      target mutant TP53. We also identify unique TP53-dependent perturbances in 
      protein expression patterns that could be exploited to improve iron-targeted 
      chemotherapeutic strategies.

TI  - Gene Expression of the D-Series Resolvin Pathway Predicts Activation of 
      Anti-Tumor Immunity and Clinical Outcomes in Head and Neck Cancer.
LID - 10.3390/ijms23126473 [doi]
LID - 6473
AB  - In human medicine, the progression from early neoplasia development to either 
      complete resolution of tumorigenesis and associated inflammation or chronicity 
      and fatal outcomes remain difficult to predict. Resolution of inflammation is an 
      active process that stimulates the termination of the inflammatory response and 
      promotes return to homeostasis, while failure in resolution contributes to the 
      development of a number of diseases. To understand how resolution pathways 
      contribute to tumorigenesis, we defined and employed a cumulative score based on 
      the expression level of genes involved in synthesis, signaling, and metabolism of 
      the D-series resolvin (RvD). This score was used for comparative analyses of 
      clinical, cellular, and molecular features of tumors, based on RNA-sequencing 
      (RNA-seq) datasets collected within The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) program. Our 
      results indicate that higher RvD scores are associated with better clinical 
      outcome of patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC), and with 
      molecular and cellular signatures indicative of enhanced anti-tumor immunity and 
      better response to immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), also in human papilloma 
      virus (HPV) negative HNSC subtypes. Thus, higher activity of the RvD pathway 
      identifies patients with improved resolution and a more efficient immune reaction 
      against cancer.

AB  - Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is an epidemic affecting 30% of the US 
      population. It is characterized by insulin resistance, and by defective lipid 
      metabolism and mitochondrial dysfunction in the liver. SLC25A34 is a major 
      repressive target of miR-122, a miR that has a central role in NAFLD and liver 
      cancer. However, little is known about the function of SLC25A34. To investigate 
      SLC25A34 in vitro, mitochondrial respiration and bioenergetics were examined 
      using hepatocytes depleted of Slc25a34 or overexpressing Slc25a34. To test the 
      function of SLC25A34 in vivo, a hepatocyte-specific knockout mouse was generated, 
      and loss of SLC25A34 was assessed in mice maintained on a chow diet and a 
      fast-food diet (FFD), a model for NAFLD. Hepatocytes depleted of Slc25a34 
      displayed increased mitochondrial biogenesis, lipid synthesis, and ADP/ATP ratio; 
      Slc25a34 overexpression had the opposite effect. In the knockout model on chow 
      diet, SLC25A34 loss modestly affected liver function (altered glucose metabolism 
      was the most pronounced defect). RNA-sequencing revealed changes in metabolic 
      processes, especially fatty acid metabolism. After 2 months on FFD, knockouts had 
      a more severe phenotype, with increased lipid content and impaired glucose 
      tolerance, which was attenuated after longer FFD feeding (6 months). This work 
      thus presents a novel model for studying SLC25A34 in vivo in which SLC25A34 plays 
      a role in mitochondrial respiration and bioenergetics during NAFLD.

AB  - Ovarian cancer ranks fifth in terms of cancer mortality in women due to lack of 
      early diagnosis and poor clinical management. Characteristics like high cellular 
      proliferation, EMT and metabolic alterations contribute to oncogenicity. Cancer, 
      being a "metabolic disorder," is governed by various key regulatory factors like 
      metabolic enzymes, oncogenes, and tumor suppressors. Sirtuins (SIRT1-SIRT7) 
      belong to the group of NAD(+) deacetylase and ADP-ribosylation enzymes that 
      function as NAD(+) sensors and metabolic regulators. Among sirtuin orthologs, 
      SIRT6 emerges as an important oncogenic player, although its possible mechanistic 
      involvement in ovarian cancer advancement is still elusive. Our data indicated a 
      higher expression of SIRT6 in ovarian cancer tissues compared with the 
      non-malignant ovarian tissue. Further, we observed that overexpression of SIRT6 
      enhances glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation in ovarian cancer cells. The 
      energy derived from these processes facilitates migration and invasion through 
      invadopodia formation by reorganization of actin fibers. Mechanistically, SIRT6 
      has been shown to promote ERK1/2-driven activatory phosphorylation of DRP1 at 
      serine-616, which has an obligatory role in inducing mitochondrial fission. These 
      fragmented mitochondria facilitate cell movement important for metastases. 
      siRNA-mediated downregulation of SIRT6 was found to decrease cellular invasion 
      through compromised mitochondrial fragmentation and subsequent reduction in 
      stress fiber formation in ovarian cancer cells. Thus, the present report 
      establishes the impact of SIRT6 in the regulation of morphological and functional 
      aspects of mitochondria that modulates invasion in ovarian cancer cells.

AB  - Direct myocardial and vascular injuries due to severe acute respiratory syndrome 
      coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection-driven inflammation is the leading cause of 
      acute cardiac injury associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). 
      However, in-depth knowledge of the injury characteristics of the heart affected 
      by inflammation is lacking. In this study, using a quantitative spatial 
      proteomics strategy that combines comparative anatomy, laser-capture 
      microdissection, and histological examination, we establish a region-resolved 
      proteome map of the myocardia and microvessels with obvious inflammatory cells 
      from hearts of patients with COVID-19. A series of molecular dysfunctions of 
      myocardia and microvessels is observed in different cardiac regions. The 
      myocardia and microvessels of the left atrial are the most susceptible to virus 
      infection and inflammatory storm, suggesting more attention should be paid to the 
      lesion and treatment of these two parts. These results can guide in improving 
      clinical treatments for cardiovascular diseases associated with COVID-19.

TI  - HemI 2.0: an online service for heatmap illustration.

AB  - Recent high-throughput omics techniques have produced a large amount of 
      biological data. Visualization of big omics data is essential to answer a wide 
      range of biological problems. As a concise but comprehensive strategy, a heatmap 
      can analyze and visualize high-dimensional and heterogeneous biomolecular 
      expression data in an attractive artwork. In 2014, we developed a stand-alone 
      software package, Heat map Illustrator (HemI 1.0), which implemented three 
      clustering methods and seven distance metrics for heatmap illustration. Here, we 
      significantly improved 1.0 and released the online service of HemI 2.0, in which 
      7 clustering methods and 22 types of distance metrics were implemented. In HemI 
      2.0, the clustering results and publication-quality heatmaps can be exported 
      directly. For an in-depth analysis of the data, we further added an option of 
      enrichment analysis for 12 model organisms, with 15 types of functional 
      annotations. The enrichment results can be visualized in five idioms, including 
      bubble chart, bar graph, coxcomb chart, pie chart and word cloud. We anticipate 
      that HemI 2.0 can be a helpful web server for visualization of biomolecular 
      expression data, as well as the additional enrichment analysis. HemI 2.0 is 
      freely available for all users at: https://hemi.biocuckoo.org/.
